  <h1>The Asset Browser</h1>
  <p>The core of your game will be created from assets added to the <strong>Asset Browser</strong> located by default on the right of the <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="IDE" href="#">IDE</a>. This is where you can add everything that your game requires
    to run, including a game room, <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="sprites" href="#">sprites</a>, objects, paths and a number of other things. A basic game in GameMaker Studio 2 will require a room to run in (new projects will always be created with
    a room asset already created), and usually at least one object and a sprite, although you&#39;ll likely use a lot more!</p>
  <p><img alt="The Asset Browser Components" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_AssetBrowser.png" /></p>
  <p>The Asset Browser is where you&#39;ll create and organise the assets for your game as well as modify certain other aspects like platform specific settings and configurations. Below you can find explanations of each of the different sections.</p>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop_down" href="#">Search Bar</a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down">
    <p class="dropspot">The Search Bar is where you can type in some text and use it to filter what is shown in the main asset list below. For example typing &quot;room&quot; will show you all the assets that contain &quot;room&quot; in their name. To reset the asset list
      back to it&#39;s default view, simply delete any text from the search bar.</p>
    <p class="dropspot"> </p>
  </div>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop_down1" href="#">Add Asset</a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down1">
    <p class="dropspot">With the Add Asset button you can choose to add a new asset to the asset list. Clicking this will open the following window:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Create Asset Window" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_AssetBrowser_AddAsset.png" /></p>
    <p class="dropspot">You can choose which of the two views above to use by clicking either the <img alt="List Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_List.png" width="20" /> list icon or <img alt="Grid Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Grid.png"
      /> grid icon, and you can also click the <img alt="Import Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Import.png" /> Import icon to import an already existing asset from another project. If you don&#39;t want to import anything, then simply
      select the asset you want to create and click the Create button at the bottom. Note that you are not limited to adding only a single asset here, as you can set the number to create at the bottom of the window, and then click Create and that number
      of the chosen asset will be added to the asset browser for you. All assets created in this way will be added to the bottom of the asset list, outside of any folders, and also will be opened in the current workspace ready for editing.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">The assets that you can add here are listed further down in this section of the manual.</p>

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down2">
    <p class="dropspot">Clicking the Asset Filter button will open the following window:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Asset Browser Filter Options" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_AssetBrowser_AssetFilter.png" />Here you can choose how to filter and display the assets listed in the asset browser. You can order them from A - Z or from
      Z - A as well as choose to order the folders first and then the assets within the folders, or order everything altogether. If you select the <strong>Custom Order</strong> filter, then you can select one or more assets and drag them up or down the
      asset browser tree and position them as you require (note that the &quot;folders first&quot; option will be disabled).</p>
    <p class="dropspot">You can also select one or more asset type to filter and only the assets that are in the project of those types will be shown in the asset list. Selecting &quot;Any Type&quot; will reset the filter. You can also filter using any tags that you have
      assigned (tags are discussed further down in this section of the manual). Note that if you have selected any filter other than &quot;Any Type&quot; then the filter button will change colour to give a visual indication that filtering is active.</p>

  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop_down4" href="#">Quick Access</a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down4">
    <p class="dropspot">This section of the asset browser is used to give you various methods to quickly access important or frequently used assets, and is split into the following sections:</p>
    <ul class="dropspotlist">
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Recent</strong>: Here you can find a list of the most recently used assets. By default a maximum of 10 assets will be listed here, but you can change this from the <a href="../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/Asset_Browser_Preferences.htm">Asset Browser Preferences</a>.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Favourites</strong>: Once you have added some assets to the asset list, you may have some that you access frequently at any given time and so to make things easier you can flag these assets as &quot;favourites&quot;, which will add them
        to this list and let you quickly find them. To flag an asset as a <em>favourite</em> use the right mouse button <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" /> on it and select Favourite from the pop-up menu. Note
        that you can use the right mouse button <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" /> again to <em>unfavourite </em>any asset, and if you use the button on the main Favourites folder, you can select <em>Clear All</em>        to remove everything.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Room Order</strong>: From here you can change the order that your rooms will run in. All projects require at least one room to run and the room at the top of the list is the &quot;home&quot; room and will be the first room entered when the
        game initially starts (it is flagged with a &quot;home&quot; icon <img alt="The Home Room Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_AssetHome.png" />). To quickly change room order, simply click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"
        /> and drag the room up or down the list and then release the mouse button to place it at the new position. If you click the &quot;home&quot; icon, then you will open the <strong>Room Manager</strong> and if you use the right mouse button <img
          alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" /> on a room you can create a <strong>child </strong>room. For more information on room order and child rooms please see the page on the <a href="../Settings/The_Room_Manager.htm">Room Manager</a>.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Saved Filters</strong>: When using the filtering options, you may want to save the selection you&#39;ve made for future reference. To do that, set up the filter as explained further up this page, and then click the right mouse button <img
          alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" /> on this option and select <em>Save Filter</em>. The filter will be saved to this list and you can rename it if required. To use the filter, simply double click <img alt="LMB Icon"
          class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" /> on it or use the right mouse button <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" /> menu option <em>Apply Filter</em>. You can also <em>Delete </em>and <em>Rename </em>saved
        filters from the RMB <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" /> menu.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Tags</strong>: All assets in the Asset Browser can be assigned user-defined <strong>Tags</strong>. These will then be listed here and you can use them to filter the assets shown in the asset list and you can double-click <img alt="LMB Icon"
          class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" /> any tag (or use the right mouse button <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" /> option <em>Filter By Tag</em>) to apply that tag to the asset list filter.
        Any applied tags are shown at the bottom of the asset browser in the <strong>Information </strong>section. For more information on tags, see further down in this page.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Game Options</strong>: Here you can quickly access the various different <strong>Game Options</strong> for your project. These control various different aspects of the project related to setting up and compiling for the different target
        platforms (what Game Options are available will depend on what licence type you have). You can find more information on each of the options listed from the section on the <a href="../Settings/Game_Options.htm">Game Options</a>.</li>

  </div>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop_down11" href="#">Asset List</a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down11">
    <p class="dropspot">This section of the asset browser lists all the different assets that you are using in your game. By default - when you create a new project - this will be populated with numerous folder groups labelled with the different kinds of assets that can
      be added, but these can be renamed or even removed and you don&#39;t have to store assets of the same kind in each group. For example, you may find it more useful to ceate a group of assets for each level of your game rather than for each kind of
      asset, so you can create folder groups called &quot;Level 1&quot;, &quot;Level 2&quot;, etc... and store all the different assets for each level in the same folder. How you organise things really is up to you!</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Asset Browser Example" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_AssetBrowser_CustomList.png" /> To add a new asset to the list you can use the <strong>Add Asset</strong> button at the top of the Asset Browser, or you can open
      the right mouse button <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" /> menu anywhere in the asset list and then select the resource to create:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Create Asset RMB Menu" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_AssetBrowser_CreateAsset.png" /> Once the asset has been created it will be opened in the workspace and you can rename it to something that is appropriate to your
      game, but note that asset names can only be alpha-numeric, cannot start with a number, and can only use the underscore &quot;_&quot; as an additional character. You can also use the right button menu to create new folder groups to contain assets
      using the <strong>Create Group</strong> option, and these can be named anything you wish. If you want to rename any asset or folder group, then you can do a slow double-click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"
      /> on them or use the RMB <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" /> menu option <em>Rename</em>.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">An important feature of the asset browser is the ability to colour assets so they are more immediately recognisable within the list. You can do this by clicking the right mouse button <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png"
      /> on the asset list node on the left and then selecting a colour from the colour picker palette that pops up. If you do this on a folder, then this will also colour any asset contained within the folder:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Colour Asset Groups" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_AssetBrowser_ColourGroup.gif" />Note that when opening the colour picker palette from a node like this, you can then right-click <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png"
      /> on any of the colour swatches to generate a custom colour to use.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">Individual assets can also be coloured independently of the group colour by using the RMB  <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" /> on the asset note or by using the palette at the bottom of the RMB <img alt="Icon RMB"
        class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" /> menu (although this can be disabled from the <a href="../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/Asset_Browser_Preferences.htm">Asset Browser Preferences</a>) and note that you
      can use <img alt="Shift Key Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Shift.png" width="55" /> or <img alt="CTRL Key Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55" /> / <img alt="CMD Key Icon"
        class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55" /> along with the left mouse button <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" /> to select multiple assets and assign the colour to all
      of them at once:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Colour Assets" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_AssetBrowser_ColourAsset.gif" /></p>
    <p class="dropspot">How you colour things is up to you - it can be by asset type, or by use, or by any other criteria!</p>
    <p class="dropspot">One final thing to note with the asset list is that you can select folders and assets then click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" /> and drag them to move them out of - or into - any other folder group in
      the asset list, and you can also delete any or all of the folder groups if they are not required, keeping the assset list tidy and only showing the required elements for the project.</p>
    <p class="dropspot"> </p>

  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop_down6" href="#">Information</a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down6">
    <p class="dropspot">The information bar at the bottom of the Asset Browser shows you how many assets are in the asset list in total, as well as the number of assets that are currently selected. This section will also show any tags that have been used to filter the asset
      list (see below for more information on tags), and you can click on them to remove the tag filter if required.</p>

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down7">
    <p class="dropspot">The Zoom Controls can be used to make the contents of the asset browser larger or smaller, with a minimum of 50% to a maximum of 250% of the current DPI of the GameMaker Studio 2 IDE. If you wish to reset this to the default 100%, then simply double-click
      <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" /> on the percentage value to the left of the slider. Note that there are a couple of preferences available to deal with how this works in the <a href="../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/Asset_Browser_Preferences.htm">Asset Browser Preferences</a>.</p>
  </div>
  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <h1>Tags</h1>
  <p>As mentioned in various of the sections above, the asset browser gives you the ability to add tags to individual assets as well as to group folders. Tags are a very powerful tool, not only for organising and filtering the assets listed in the asset
    browser, but also when programming your game in general, as you can use assigned tags in code.</p>
  <p>To create a tag you need to use the RMB <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" /> menu on either a folder group or an asset and then select the <em>Edit Tag</em> option. This will bring up the <strong>Tag Editor</strong>    where you can type in the tag you want to use, and then press  to apply it:</p>
  <p><img alt="The Tag Editor" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_AssetBrowser_EditTags.gif" />You can assign multiple tags to a single item, and you can also use <img alt="Shift Key Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Shift.png"
      width="55" /> or <img alt="CTRL Key Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55" /> / <img alt="CMD Key Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55" /> along with the left
    mouse button <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" /> to select multiple assets and assign a tag to all of them at once. You can also add a tag to a folder group, which will apply it to all the assets within the
    folder. Once added, all tags will be visible under the Quick Access menu and also in the Filter options (as explained in the sections above), and so can be used to quickly filter the asset list and show only those items with the chosen tag or tags.</p>
  <p>It is important to note that assets that are created while tags are part of the active filter <strong>will be given those tags automatically</strong>. This means that if you are viewing all assets under the &quot;Level 1&quot; tag - for example - all
    new assets created with this filter active will also have the &quot;Level 1&quot; tag added to them upon creation.</p>
  <p>Finally, tags can also be used in your project code to identify any asset and then act on it, making it a very powerful tool as you can code behaviours based on a tag or group of tags. For example, imagine you have a project with a &quot; <span class="inline">Die On Touch</span>&quot;
    tag. When programming the project, you can check this tag and code functionality that is appropriate, then later the artists and level designers can create new assets of any type and tag them with the &quot; <span class="inline">Die On Touch</span>&quot;
    tag then use the asset when designing a level. Any code that has been programmed already to use this tag will automatically include these new assets.</p>
  <p>For more information on using tags in the project code, please see the section on <a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Assets_And_Tags/Assets_And_Tags.htm">Assets And Tags</a>.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <h1>RMB Menu</h1>
  <p>When working with the Asset Browser, you can use the right mouse button <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" /> on any resource or folder to open a menu of options:</p>
  <p><img alt="Asset Browser RMB Menu" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_RMBMenu.png" />The exact options available to you will depend on the context that has been clicked, and below we show the contents when the menu is opened on an asset
    or folder group in the Asset List (other contexts will show some of these but not all):</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><strong>Create </strong>- Create a new asset. On selecting this you will be presented with a list of the available asset types that can be created for you to select one. Note that if you open this menu on a specific asset, there will be an additional
      option to create a resource if the same type listed just below so you don&#39;t have to look for the asset type in the list.</li>
    <li><strong>Edit (All) </strong>- Open the resource properties editor for the selected asset(s) or folder group (note that you can double click <img alt="Icon LMB" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21" /> on a single
      asset too to open it for it editing).</li>
    <li><strong>Edit Tags</strong> - This will open the Tag editor where you can add or remove tags to the selected asset(s) or folder group(s).</li>
    <li><strong>Rename </strong>- Rename the asset or the folder group.</li>
    <li><strong>Duplicate </strong>- Create a duplicate of the asset or assets that have been selected.</li>
    <li><strong>Favourite </strong>- Flag an asset or assets as being a favourite, adding it to the Quick Access section at the top of the Asset browser.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Existing</strong> - Add existing assets from a different GameMaker Studio 2 project folder. Please note that assets created using a version anterior to 2.3.0 will require conversion as the project file format changed with the 2.3.0 update.
      This means it may be preferable to import the entire project and converting everything then saving it to a new location if the assets are imported frequently into other projects.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Existing From My Library</strong> - Add assets to the asset list from an item in your Marketplace library. Please note that Marketplace assets created using a version anterior to 2.3.0 will require conversion as the project file format
      changed with the 2.3.0 update.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete </strong>- Delete the selected asset(s) from the project. This cannot be undone!</li>
    <li><strong>Create Group</strong> - Add a new folder group to the asset list.</li>
    <li><strong>Expand Children</strong> - Expand the currently selected folder group along with any sub-folders it may contain.</li>
    <li><strong>Expand All</strong> - Expand all the folder groups in the asset list.</li>
    <li><strong>Contract All</strong> - Contract all the folder groups in the asset list.</li>
    <li><strong>Open In New Asset Browser</strong> - This option is only available for folder groups, and it will open the group in a new Asset browser window containing only the contents of the parent group the option was selected for.</li>
    <li><strong>Open in Explorer</strong> - This will open the file explorer on the location of the file that has been stored for the resource in your project folder.</li>
    <li><strong>Colour Swatches</strong> - Here you can select a new colour for the asset to use. If used on a folder group, all assets within the folder will get the chosen colour, and if used on one or more assets, this will override any colour set in for
      the folder group (unless you have overridden this option in the <a href="../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/Asset_Browser_Preferences.htm">Asset Browser Preferences</a>).</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <h1>Asset Types</h1>
  <p>Now you know how the Asset Browser works, you should get to know the different types of asset that you can add to it. Below we give an overview of each of the different asset types available for you to use in your projects:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px"><img alt="Animation Curve Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Curves.png" />  <a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop_down17" href="#">Animation Curves</a>
    <undefined data-targetname="drop_down8"></undefined>
  </p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down17">
    <p class="dropspot">An animation curve is a resource that contains one or more curves that represent how a value changes over time, and can use <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="linear interpolation" href="#">linear interpolation</a> or <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="catmull-rom interpolation"
        href="#">catmull-rom interpolation</a> to go between values in the curve. The values you set can be between -1 and 1 on the vertical axis and the duration along the horizontal axis is always normalised form 0 to 1, making it easy to target different
      time ranges using multipliers in your game code. Animation curves are comprised of &quot;channels&quot; and each channel can have its own curve settings, which permits you to - for example - describe a spacial position with two channels for the
      x/y position, or a colour gradient with 4 channels to represent a colour format. Animation curve assets can be used when working with sequences and can also be accessed using code, making them a powerful tool when creating your games.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">You can find out more about adding animation curves from the section on <a href="../The_Asset_Editors/Animation_Curves.htm">Animation Curves</a>.</p>

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down9">
    <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down9">
      <p class="dropspot">Extensions are additional files and code that you can add to extend the GameMaker Studio 2 functionality as well as add assets to your game from the <a href="The_Marketplace.htm">Marketplace</a>. The format for an extension will vary depending on
        the final target platform, although in general they are written in C++, C# or JavaScript.</p>

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down12">
    <p class="dropspot">When you want to draw text in your game this text will be drawn in a standard Arial 12 points font by default, but to make more interesting or unique looking texts you will probably want to use different fonts. This is where the <strong>Font Editor</strong>      is used. Here you can select a font that you have on your computer and import it into GameMaker Studio 2 for use in your game, setting various attributes like size and weight or style. Once imported and added as a resource, you can then set it for

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down14">
    <p class="dropspot">Objects are a special resource that we use to control aspects of a game and to do specific things. Most of the time they have <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="sprites" href="#">sprites</a> associated with them so that you see them in the game
      room, but sometimes they are used as a &quot;behind the scenes&quot; controller to do things related to the user or for timing, etc... They can be given behaviours and they can react to certain events as well as to each other, and most of the things
      you see in a game are based on objects and their interactions. Note that we say &quot;based on&quot; because you don&#39;t actually place objects directly into the game room, but rather you place <strong>instances </strong>of these objects, which
      are basically copies (or clones if you prefer) of the object resource. This is a very important thing to remember as instances and objects are not the same thing and each have their own set of functions that can affect them.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">All objects have a set of properties which you can specify in the object editor, like the sprite, whether it uses <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="physics" href="#">physics</a> or not, or whether it is a &quot;child&quot; object of another one.
      They also have a series of built-in variables that can then be used in actions, scripts and code. These built-in variables are used to define the position of the instance when placed in the game room, the animation speed, the direction of movement
      and a whole host of other things. To control how the object behaves over time, each game frame is split into a series of events, so you can add code or actions into a specific event and it will only run when the event is triggered, and events can
      be triggered by things like mouse button presses or collisions with other instances.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">Objects are in a very real sense the building blocks of your game, and together with rooms will form the core of any project that you create.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">The RMB <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" /> menu for objects contains the following option (as well as those listed further up this page):</p>

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down18">
    <p class="dropspot">At some point while creating your games you may need an instance of one of your objects to follow a path through a level. Now, this can be done by simply creating an array of positions within the room and then having the instance move between them,
      but that can be a chore to set up and is difficult to change, test and adapt for different things. That is when you&#39;d want to create a path resource.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">The basic idea of the path resource is rather simple - you define a path by drawing it in the path editor, then you can place an action (or code) in an event of an object to tell the object to follow that particular path in the game room. You can
      set the speed to follow the path and a number of other actions relating to the position and orientation of the path within the room too.</p>

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down19">
    <p class="dropspot">All games that you make in GameMaker Studio 2 need at least one room to run (but can have many, many more) , and a room is basically a space where you place instances of the objects that make up your game and where the action of the game will take
      place. However the Room Editor is one of the most powerful of resources available to you, since it permits you to not only add instances of objects, but to set up the &quot;view&quot; into the game room, add the backgrounds and tiles that are drawn
      to create the game world, create extra special effects that are independent of the object/instance system, and as well as run code independently of an object. Rooms can also be set to <strong>inherit </strong>properties from other rooms, meaning
      that you can create a single room with a load of tiles, for example, and then make another room that inherits these tiles, so that you don&#39;t have to re-create them again.</p>

    <p class="dropspot">A script resource is simply a container for one or more functions you have written. For example, say you want to have all your enemy objects create a number of different instances when they die - like some gold, an explosion and some blood as well
      as play a sound. Now you could add all the required code into each object that requires it, but in general you&#39;d be better off creating a single function in script resource and then calling that. This means that you only have to add one line
      of code into the objects to call this new scripted function, and if you wish to change something you only need to change it once in the script and all the objects will automatically run the new code, rather than have to go through every object and

    <p class="dropspot">Shaders are a very powerful tool that can be used to manipulate the graphics that your game renders to the screen, permitting incredibly fast effects that can range from, for example, adding a subtle colour hue to a sprite, right up to full screen
      distortion effects. Basically it&#39;s a two-part program that runs directly on the graphics card itself, making it very fast since the GPU is doing all the work and freeing up CPU cycles for your game code. The full shader is comprised of a vertex
      shader program, and a fragment shader program (also known as a pixel shader). Both of these tiny programs work together in order to manipulate what the graphics card renders to the screen. This then permits you to manipulate in real time the position,
      colour, and alpha values that are actually rendered into the display buffer.</p>
