  <h1>Workspaces</h1>
  <p>After logging in and starting a new project, GameMaker Studio 2 will take you to the initial <strong>workspace </strong>with some basic windows docked to the <a class="tooltip" title="The IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. In this case, the entire frontend of GameMaker Studio 2 is considered the IDE, and includes sections to create graphics, add sounds, and add code to make your games.">IDE</a>. In general, the workspace is simply
    an area where you can organise the different assets for your game while you are working:</p>
  <p><img alt="Workspaces" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_Workspace.png"/></p>
  <p>As you can see, the initial workspace is on a tab at the top of the screen (and you can rename it by double clicking the tab), but you can create further workspaces for the project by clicking the <img alt="Add New Workspace" class="icon" height="32" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/Icon_Add.png" style="max-width: 20px; max-height: 20px;" width="32"/> to the side, giving you multiple possible workspaces for any single project. For example, maybe you are working on interactions between the player
    and several enemy objects, so you&#39;d have the player on it&#39;s own workspace and the enemy objects in another, and perhaps another workspace only to show the scripts that both use.</p>
  <p>Another important feature of workspaces is that you can click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21"/> on the tab and - still holding the mouse button <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21"/> down - drag it off of the main IDE window into its own individual window, making it very easy to organise things if you are using - for example - multiple displays. You also merge these secondary
    workspace windows back into the main one by dragging the tab back onto the first window. Note that although you appear to have two instances of the IDE running when you do this, they are <strong>both for the same project</strong> and you cannot have
    one project in one and another in the other unless you specifically open two instances of GameMaker Studio 2.</p>
  <p>When you first start GameMaker Studio 2, your workspace will already be populated by a couple of windows which will be &quot; <strong>docked</strong>&quot; to the IDE. These are explained briefly below:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><strong>Output </strong>- You can also see in the image above the <a href="The_Output_Window.htm">Output Window</a>. There are a number of sub tabs in this window related to <strong>Source Control</strong>, <strong>Searching</strong>, and <strong>Debugging</strong>,
      with the initial tab being for the console/compiler output, which shows you what is happening when you are compiling a game for testing or when creating a final package for distribution. This will also show any debug messages that you choose to
      send from your project at runtime, and can be configured to show different quantities of information from the <a href="../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/General/Output_Windows.htm">General Preferences</a>. If you close the output
      window and wish to recover it you can use the <a href="../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Windows_Menu.htm">Windows Menu</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Assets </strong>- On the right of the screen you can find the <a href="The_Asset_Browser.htm"> <strong>Asset Browser</strong></a>. Here is where you can create and edit the different assets that your game uses, as well as generate and change
      configurations, game options, room order and other things. Assets are created by right-clicking <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png"/> on an asset folder (or anywhere in the main Asset Browser view) and selecting
      <strong>Create</strong>, or by clicking the plus icon at the top and selecting an asset from the <strong>Create </strong><strong>Asset</strong> window (note that with this method you can create multiple assets of the same type at a time, by setting
      the value at the bottom):<br/>
      <br/>
      <img alt="Resources Menu" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_ResourcesMenu.png"/>Selecting any one of these options will create a new, empty resource of the given type for you, with the name field highlighted so you can immediately
      give it a name. Note that while the Asset Browser is docked to the IDE by default, you can take it out and into its own window by clicking <img alt="Icon LMB" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21"/> on the
      &quot;Asset Browser&quot; text at the top and dragging. You can re-dock it again at any time by dragging it to the sides or bottom of the IDE. If you close the Asset Browser window and wish to recover it you can use the <a href="../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Windows_Menu.htm">Windows Menu</a>.
      For more information on the available assets please see the section on <a href="../The_Asset_Editors/The_Asset_Editors.htm">Editors</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There are also a set of preferences related to how certain things will be displayed in the workspace so you can customise how it looks as well as certain aspects of the general workflow. You can find these preferences from the following page:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><a href="../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/General/Workspace.htm">Workspace Preferences</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <h1>Workspace RMB Menu</h1>
  <p>While within any workspace you can call up the Right Button Menu at any time by right-clicking <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png"/> anywhere, which will open the following menu:</p>
  <p><img alt="RMB Menu Options" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_RMB_Options.png"/></p>
  <p>Clicking <strong>Assets </strong>will open up a list of all the assets in the <a href="The_Asset_Browser.htm">Asset Browser</a> that you can create, and selecting any one of them will create that asset resource for you, as well as focus the workspace
    on the editor window for that resource. If you click the <strong>Windows </strong>option, you will be shown a list of all the currently open windows within the workspace and you can select any of them to have the workspace focus on that window. Finally
    you have the <strong>Go To </strong>option which will open the following window:</p>
  <p><img alt="Goto Window" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_Goto.png"/></p>
  <p>This window permits you to search though every asset, <strong>Game Option</strong> or <strong>Preference </strong>in your project for the search term you input. For example, typing &quot;icon&quot; as the search term will show all items in your project
    that have icon somewhere in their name, eg: if a sprite is <tt> <span class="inline">spr_Icon_Play</span></tt>, then it will show up here, as will the object &quot; <span class="inlinecode"> <span class="inline">obj_Iconoclast</span></span>&quot;,
    and you&#39;ll even see the Game Options for the different icons like &quot; <strong>Icon for hdpi</strong>&quot;. Clicking on any of the items shown on filtered list will open it in the current workspace or focus the workspace on it if it is already
    open. Note that you can also use the keyboard shortcut <img alt="CTRL Key Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55"/> / <img alt="CMD Key Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55"/> + <strong>T</strong> to open the Go To window, and that the number of items listed is (by default) set to a maximum of 16, but this can be changed from the Go To section of the <a href="../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/General/Go_To.htm">General Preferences</a>.</p>
  <p>For more information on Workspace Navigation, please see the section on <a href="../IDE_Navigation/IDE_Input.htm">IDE Input and Navigation</a>.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <h1>Docking</h1>
  <p>We mentioned briefly above that you can dock many windows into the current workspace window and you can un-dock those that are already docked. If you click <img alt="Icon LMB" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21"/> on, for example, the Asset Browser tab at the top and drag it to the left of the current workspace, you will see that it becomes a free floating window.</p>
  <p><img alt="Un-docking the asset browser" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_UnDocking.gif"/>This converse is true and if you drag certain windows to the sides of the workspace (or the bottom) then they will be docked, meaning that
    it essentially becomes part of the IDE window overlay and is no longer independent. When doing this, you drag the window to the area you want to dock to and it will be highlighted to show that you can dock the window there:</p>
  <p><img alt="Docking The Asset Browser" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_Docking.gif"/>In this way you can create a personalised IDE experience that fits your workflow and way of doing things. It&#39;s worth noting that all docked
    windows can be hidden/unhidden individually by clicking the button to the side of the docked items (highlighted in the image at the top of this page), or you can hide/unhide all docked items using the quick-button  <img alt="Docking Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Docking.png" width="24"/> at the top of the IDE, and note too that the IDE will remember docked windows between sessions.</p>
  <p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong>: Some windows will disappear from the dock when you change editors, like in the room editor. However when you return to the editor in question, they will be re-opened in the dock again.</p>

  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <h1>Quick Buttons</h1>
  <p>Below we list the quick buttons that are available by default with GameMaker Studio 2. These buttons can be found at the top of the IDE and represent many of the most common commands that you&#39;ll be using while working in GameMaker Studio 2 to make
    your workflow smoother (note that most of these buttons have an equivalent <a href="../IDE_Navigation/Menus.htm">menu option</a> too):</p>

        <td class="text">Pressing this button will clear the current asset compiler cache. GameMaker Studio 2 stores images, sounds, scripts etc... between use in a cache so as to save time when testing your game as it will only re-compile those things that have been
          changed before testing. However, this cache may become corrupted or &quot;stale&quot; over time, or you may wish to do a full test with no caching being done previously, in which case you can clear the cache by pressing this button.
