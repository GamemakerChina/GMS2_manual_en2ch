  <h1>Compiling</h1>
  <p><a class="tooltip" title="Compiling is when GameMaker takes your code and collects it together in such a way as to create an executable package that will run on a device as a game.">Compiling</a> your game can mean one of two things: compiling it for testing, or compiling it to create an <em> <a class="tooltip" title="A package of files that are used to execute a program. In GameMaker Studio this can be a single file - like an installer for windows - or multiple files - like the HTML5 output.">executable package</a></em> or
    a specific target platform. Compiling your game for testing can be done by simply pressing the Play button  <img alt="Play Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_PlayGame.png"/> at the top of the IDE, which will launch the game for testing
    using the specified target. You can also run the game in <strong>Debug Mode</strong> by testing using the Debug button <img alt="Debug Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Debug.png"/>. This will run the game, but also open up the
    <strong>Debug Window</strong>, where you can monitor how your game performs and see any issues (see the section on <a href="Debugging.htm">Debugging</a> for more information).</p>
  <p>By default GameMaker Studio 2 will run and debug using the built in <a class="tooltip" title="In GameMaker, the The VM (Virtual Machine) is a compiling method that uses a generic runner for each platform and then uses that to interpret the code for your game.">Virtual Machine (VM)</a>, which is more or less the same as running on the desktop OS being used. However GameMaker
    Studio 2 is a <strong>cross platform engine</strong> and you can test, debug and compile executable packages of your projects on a number of different target platforms (the exact platforms available will depend on the details of your licence). To
    change the current target platform you can click <img alt="Icon LMB" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21"/> on the Targets button <img alt="Target Manager Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Targets.png"/> to open the <strong>Targets Window</strong>, which will look something like this (exact details will vary based on your licence type):</p>
  <p><img alt="Target List" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_TargetList.png"/></p>
  <p>At the top, beside the Targets button, you have the current settings which tells you the platform and the specific settings actually being used, and then the rest of the window is taken up with the details and options for all the available targets which
    you can select to use instead. Each section of this window is explained below:</p>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop_down" href="#"><span data-open-text="true">Worker</span><span data-close-text="true">Worker</span></a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down">
    <p class="dropspot">The first column of the Target Manager is dedicated to the <strong> <a class="tooltip" title="A Remote Worker is a special program that GameMaker Studio 2 will use on certain platforms to create your game executables without actually running the GameMaker Studio 2 IDE on that platform">Remote Workers</a></strong> that you have available. To begin with, you will only have a single &quot;Local&quot; machine
      listed here, which is the machine that GameMaker Studio 2 is installed on, but you can also configure a Remote Worker to use. When a Remote Worker has been configured, you will then be able to select it from the list here, and have it build your
      projects rather than use the host machine where GameMaker Studio 2 is installed.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">For more information on how to set up and use Remote Workers, please see the section below:</p>
    <ul class="colour">

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down2">
    <p class="dropspot">This section lists all the available target platforms. The contents of this list will vary depending on the licence that you have, but will always have at least the &quot;Test&quot; target. To select a target, simply click <img alt="Icon LMB" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21"/> on it. This will then update the rest of the options windows to show different details depending on the platform selected.</p>
    <p class="dropspot"> </p>

  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop_down3" href="#"><span data-open-text="true">Output</span><span data-close-text="true">Output</span></a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down3">
    <p class="dropspot">Each target platform can have one or more output formats, the main ones being:</p>
    <ul class="dropspotlist">
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>VM</strong>: The VM (Virtual Machine) target uses a generic <em>runner </em>for each platform and then interprets the code for your game. In general this option is used for testing due to its faster build times, but it does not offer the
        same performance boost that using the YYC option (if available) offers. You can use this to compile executable packages for smaller games or games where performance is not ever going to be an issue.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>YYC</strong>: The YYC (YoYo Compiler) takes the normal GameMaker Studio 2 output and compiles it into native code for the target platform, &quot;stripping out&quot; unneeded functions and performing a host of other optimisation techniques
        to create a smaller and performance enhanced executable package. This can increase your games performance by at least two or three times, especially on logic-heavy games, and is ideal for those larger or CPU intensive projects. Compile times may
        take longer and you should always clear the compiler cache before building any final complete asset package for a target platform. Note that the YYC target may require extra tools to be installed for the platform selected, otherwise it will not
        work - you can find further information about this from the <a href="https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/227860547-GMS2-Required-SDKs">YoYo Games Help Center</a> as well as on the individual <a href="../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/Platform_Preferences.htm">target Preferences</a> pages
        detailed in this manual.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>JavaScript</strong>: The JavaScript target will only be available for a few targets, like the HTML5 target, and sets the game to be compiled to pure JavaScript.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="dropspot"> </p>
    <ul class="dropspotlist">

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down4">
    <p class="dropspot">Certain platforms (like iOS or Android) permit you to associate one or more devices with GameMaker Studio 2 so that games can selectively compile to them. Initially, the device list will be empty and you need to click <img alt="Icon LMB" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21"/> on the Pencil icon <img alt="Pencil Icon" class="icon" height="18" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Pencil.png" width="18"/>  to open the <strong>Device Editor</strong>:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="The Device Editor" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_DeviceEditor.png"/>Here you can add new devices as well as have GameMaker Studio 2 test for a connection to any device(s) that may be connected. The exact contents
      of this window will depend on the platform specifics (see the section on the <a href="../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/The_Device_Manager.htm">Device Manager</a> for exact details for any given platform). Once a device has been found or added,
      it will then be shown in this window, like in this example image for Android:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Add An Android Device" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_AddDevice.png"/>The exact procedure and requirements for setting up devices and troubleshooting issues can be found in the appropriate section of the <a href="https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/categories/204246668-GameMaker-Studio-2">GameMaker Studio 2 Knowledge Base</a>.</p>

  </div>
  <p> </p>
  <p>There are also a number or preferences that can be set to modify and customise the compile workflow, explained on the following page:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><a href="../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/General/Compiling.htm">Compiling Preferences</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <h1>Creating A Final Executable Package</h1>
  <p>Compiling your game project to any target platform will require that you have set up the correct <strong> <a class="tooltip" title="Build tools are external applications that GameMaker Studio 2 requires to generate executable packages for the different target platforms.">build tools</a></strong> (see <a href="../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/Required_SDKs.htm">here</a>)
    and also filled in the appropriate <a href="../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/Platform_Preferences.htm">Platform Preferences</a>. Once you have done that you can simply click the Create Executable button  <img alt="Compile Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Compile.png"/> in the IDE to start the compiler build or select <strong>Create Executable</strong> from the <a href="../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Build_Menu.htm">Build Menu</a>. Either option will open a file explorer window where you can give the final name that
    you wish to use for your game executable before clicking <em>Save </em>to start the compile and build process. Once you have done this, the necessary files will be generated so that you can distribute it as you wish.</p>
  <p class="note"><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> If you have the free <strong> 30 Day Trial Licence</strong>, then compiling a final executable will not be available, and you will be required to upgrade to one of the paid licences to compile your game for distribution.</p>
  <p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong>: Before doing a final build of your project for release, you should <strong>always clear the Asset Compiler <a class="tooltip" title="The cache is a collection of files that are generated by GameMaker once and then stored and re-used over multiple runs of a project. Note that this cache can sometimes become &#39;stale&#39;, meaning it must be cleared to force GameMaker to rebuild it from scratch, ensuring that no stale files corrupt your final game exectable.">Cache</a></strong> (using the &quot;broom&quot; icon <img alt="Clean Cache Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Clean.png"/> at the top of the IDE). GameMaker Studio 2 will cache many of your game files to keep compilation speed to a minimum.</p>
  <p>Each target option saves to a platform specific format, listed below:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><strong>Windows </strong>- Compiling for the general Windows OS will first request that you choose between creating an <em>Installer </em>or a <em>Zip </em>package, where the installer will be a single executable that will install your game, and the
      Zip file will be a single <span class="inline">*.zip</span> format compressed file with all your game files stored within (the files will need extracted for the game to run). <img alt="Windows Compile Options" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_Windows_Compile_Options.png" style="cursor: nwse-resize;"/>If you check the box marked <strong>Remember Packaging Option</strong> then GameMaker Studio 2 will remember the choice for all future compiles (this can be reset or changed from the <a href="../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/Platform_Preferences/Windows.htm">Windows Preferences</a>).
      You can find out more from the <a href="https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/sections/207157668">YoYo Games Help Center</a>. Please note that the Windows target can compile 32bit <em>or </em>64bit executables depending on what you have selected in
      the <a href="../Settings/Game_Options/Windows.htm">General Game Options</a>.  We <strong>strongly recommend that all new projects use the x64 Runtime to create 64bit executables</strong> as the 32bit runtime will be getting deprecated and removed
      in the future.</li>
    <li><strong>Ubuntu (Linux)</strong> - Ubuntu (Linux) apps can be compiled as <span class="inline">*.zip</span> files - containing either an x64 or an ARM executable - depending on the device being targeted. You can find out more from the <a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/235186168">YoYo Games Help Center</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>HTML5 </strong>- If you have chosen to build HTML5, then an <span class="inline">index.html</span> file (this is the default name, but you can give your own name too in the Platform Preferences) along with a folder containing your game files
      will be created and saved to the specified location. For your game to work you will need both of these to be uploaded to a <a class="tooltip" title="In computing, a server is a computer program or a device that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called &#39;clients&#39;.
">server</a>. The <span class="inline">index.html</span> can also be customised
      to show your game with a different background colour, or at a different position etc... but a knowledge of HTML is necessary for this, and you can also specify your own custom index file when you build the package (see the <a href="../Settings/Game_Options/HTML5.htm">HTML5 Game Options</a>).
      You can find out more from the <a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000309008">YoYo Games Help Center</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Android </strong>- For Android devices, you can choose to build an <span class="inline">*.apk</span> or an <span class="inline">*.aab</span> (Android App Bundle) file from the window that is shown for saving the game:<br/>
      <br/>
      <img alt="Andoird APK or AAB File Selector" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_AndroidFileSelector.png"/>The type of file you choose will depend on the store that you wish to target, with the <span class="inline">*.aab</span>      file being required for Google Play, while the <span class="inline">*.apk</span> file can be used on other stores. You can find out more from the <a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001368727">YoYo Games Help Center</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>iOS </strong>- Compiling to iOS will create an <span class="inline">xarchive</span> file which is then used in Xtools to create the final iOS package. Note that <strong>to compile for iOS you will require an Apple Mac computer running OSX or higher as well as the relevant certificates and permissions</strong>.
      You can find out more from the <a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001368747">YoYo Games Help Center</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>macOS </strong>- Compiling for the macOS target will first request that you choose between creating a <em>DMG </em>or a <em>Zip </em>file:<br/>
      <img class="center" height="194" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_macOS_Compile_Options.png" style="cursor: nesw-resize;" width="430"/>&quot;Package as DMG&quot; will build a .dmg installer package which can be used to install the game on
      a Mac computer. Note that during this build process you will see the installer appear on the Mac, which will disappear once the build process is complete.<br/>
      <br/> &quot;Package as Zip&quot; will build either an <span class="inline">*.app</span> file or a <span class="inline">*.pkg</span> file, depending on whether you want to later upload it to the Mac App Store or not. As with iOS <strong>you will require an Apple Mac computer running OSX or higher as well as the relevant certificates and permissions</strong>.
      You can find out more from the <a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/235186128">YoYo Games Help Center</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Windows UWP</strong> - For Windows UWP, GameMaker Studio 2 will create an <span class="inline">*.appxbundle</span> package which can then be uploaded to the Windows Store or distributed elsewhere. When you click the Create Executable button
      you will be prompted to tell GameMaker Studio 2 which type of package you would like to create (can be for ARM, x64 and/or x86 <a class="tooltip" title="The architecture of a processor chip (CPU) is a description of its basic components and of its basic operations. Each processor family has its own architecture, like ARM or x64.
">architectures</a>), and you should choose those targets that
      the game will be supported on (you must select at least one, but can select all three or any combination): <br/>
      <br/>
      <img alt="UWP Compile Options" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_UWP_Compile_Options.png"/>If you check the box marked <strong>Package For Store Upload</strong>, then the final package created will be an <span class="inline">*.appxupload</span>      file, which is what Microsoft specifies should be used for submitting apps to their store, as explained in this article <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/publish/upload-app-packages">here</a> (all chosen architectures will be
      included, just like with the <span class="inline">*.appxbundle</span>). You can find out more about setting up and compiling to UWP platform from the <a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000309028">YoYo Games Help Center</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once you have created your executable asset package you can then give the file to other people or place it on your website to download, or upload these files to the different hosting services for individual distribution or even to online stores (like
    Google Play, iTunes or the MS Store) for general distribution and retail.</p>
  <p>Note that you are free to distribute the games you create with GameMaker Studio 2 in any way you like, including selling them. Of course, this assumes that the sprites, images, and sounds you used to make it can be distributed or sold as well and that
    you have the legal rights to all assets, and it also assumes that the game complies with the <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/legal/eula">YoYo Games EULA for GameMaker Studio 2</a>.</p>
