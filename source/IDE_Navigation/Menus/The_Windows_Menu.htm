  <h1>The Windows Menu</h1>
  <p><img alt="The Windows Menu" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/IDE_Input/Window_Menu.png" /></p>
  <p>This menu is for opening the general docked IDE windows. Since docks can be re-arranged and the contents can be removed as stand-alone windows or even closed entirely, this window permits you to re-open them if you find that you need them for anything.
    The windows that can be opened from here are the <a href="../../Introduction/The_Asset_Browser.htm">Asset Browser</a> window and all the different <a href="../../Introduction/The_Output_Window.htm">Output</a> windows (Output, Search, Source Control,
    Breakpoints and Compile/Syntax Errors).</p>
  <p>Next you can open the <a href="../../IDE_Tools/The_Inspector.htm">Inspector</a> window. This window is used to inspect the properties of the currently selected IDE element, and these properties can then be edited as required.</p>
  <p>After the Inspector option you have the <a href="../Recent_Windows.htm">Recent Windows</a> list, and there is also the option to open the <strong>Environment Variables</strong> window where you can see the different paths that the various environment
    variables used in the <a href="../../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences.htm">Preferences</a> point to. These variables cannot be edited (neither their name nor their path/setting) but you can select and copy/paste any of them for use
    elsewhere.</p>
  <p><img alt="Environment Variables" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/IDE_Input/Environment_Variables.png" />Finally you have the option to open <strong>Tutorial Windows</strong>. This will re-open any windows that are related to a tutorial project
    you have opened, but only if the project is one that was created as part of a tutorial (if not, this option will be unavailable). For information on creating your own tutorial projects, please see the section on the <a href="../../Introduction/The_Marketplace.htm">Marketplace</a>    (as all tutorials are created, hosted and downloaded from there).</p>
