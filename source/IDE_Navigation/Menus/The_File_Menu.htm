  <h1>The File Menu</h1>
  <p><img alt="The File Menu" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/IDE_Input/File_Menu.png"/></p>
  <p>The file menu is where you can choose to change, save or import projects as well as set the GameMaker Studio 2 IDE preferences. The available options are:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><strong>New Project </strong>- This is for creating a new project from scratch in GameMaker Studio 2. It will open the &quot;Save&quot; dialogue and prompt you to choose a location to save the new project to. Once you have given a name to the project
      and a location to save it, you will be taken to a new, blank, <a href="../../Introduction/Workspaces.htm">workspace</a> to start working on it. Project files are saved with the <span class="inline">*.yyp</span> file extension.</li>
    <li><strong>Open Project</strong> - This will open a file explorer for you to select a previously created <span class="inline">*.yyz</span> project file for loading. Please note that on import, if the project was created using a version lower than 2.3.0,
      then you will get the following warning message: <img alt="Open old project warning message" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/IDE_Input/Open_OldProject_Warning.png"/> If you choose to proceed then a file explorer will be opened and you can
      give the project an updated name and location to save it, so the original project will not be over-written. Once the project has been converted to the new 2.3.0+ format, it will open in the IDE and you will get a message saying that the conversion
      has succeeded. You should proceed to check the compatibility report that has been generated by the conversion process and see if there is anything that you need to fix before trying to run or compile the project. Note that if you get repeated errors
      while trying to open a project made with a version anterior to 2.3.0, then you should contact YoYo Games (using the &quot;Report a bug&quot; option from the <a href="The_Help_Menu.htm">Help Menu</a>), supplying the original <span class="inline">*.yyp</span>      file that you are trying to convert.</li>
    <li><strong>Import Project</strong> - Here you can import projects that have previously been exported as a <span class="inline">*.yyz</span> archive (see &quot;Export Project&quot;, below), or - if you have a project made with the GameMaker: Studio 1.4
      software from YoYo Games - you can select this option to import either the <span class="inline">*.gmx</span> or the <span class="inline">*.gmz</span> file from that product line. As with opening a project, if the <span class="inline">*.yyz</span>      was created with a version of GameMaker Studio 2 prior to the 2.3.0 update, then it will need converting as the project file format changed with that update.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong>: To import a previous GameMaker project into GameMaker Studio 2 it must have been created using the 1.4 version, and even then it may not work directly on import. A great many things are different between GameMaker Studio 2 and
    GameMaker: Studio 1.4, and so your older projects may need some tweaking for them to work. Please see the article <a href="https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/231719468">Porting A GM:S 1.4 Game To GameMaker Studio 2</a> on the YoYo Games
    Knowledge Base and the section of the manual that covers Obsolete Functions and <a href="../../Additional_Information/Compatibility_Scripts.htm">Compatibility Scripts</a>.</p>
  <p class="note"><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> Importing a <span class="inline">*.yyz</span> project that contains font resources may require you to &quot;regenerate&quot; the fonts by removing/re-adding them, or by changing the font in the font editor and then setting
    it back again. This is because the existing font information is retained by the <span class="inline">*.yyz</span> when it is exported, and, on import later or on another machine, the project may not have the required fonts installed already (or may
    have a different font of the same name). This should only be done if you are seeing issues with how the font renders after import.</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><strong>Recent Projects</strong> - You can use this option to view recently used projects. Selecting it will re-open the <a href="../../Introduction/The_Start_Page.htm">Start Page</a> (should you have closed it) and you can select a recently used
      project from the list found there.</li>
    <li><strong>Save Project</strong> - This will save your game to the same location as you defined when you created the project (or where you opened it from).</li>
    <li><strong>Save Project As</strong> - Same as above, only you specify the location and the new name of the project.</li>
    <li><strong>Export Project </strong>- This will export the project as a single <span class="inline">*.yyz</span> file. Very useful for sending copies to people or for saving backups.</li>
    <li><strong>Preferences </strong>- Selecting this will take you to the <a href="../../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences.htm">Preferences Window</a> where you can set up how GameMaker Studio 2 looks and feel.</li>
    <li><strong>New IDE</strong> - When you select this a new instance of the IDE will be opened for you to use (it will open on the Start Page).</li>
    <li><strong>My Account</strong> - This option will open your default web browser and take you to your YoYo Account page.</li>
    <li><strong>Logout</strong> - Selecting this will log you out of GameMaker Studio 2. You will need to log in again with the same licence (or any other) to be able to use the product later.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="note"><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> If you have been using a Trial Licence for GameMaker Studio 2 and then buy one of the other licences (Desktop, Mobile, UWP, Web or Console) then you may need to log out of the IDE and then restart GameMaker Studio 2 and
    <a href="../../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/Licencing_Information.htm">log back in again</a> to make sure that the new licence is applied correctly (although this should happen automatically).</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><strong>Exit </strong>- Exit GameMaker Studio 2 to the desktop.</li>
  </ul>
