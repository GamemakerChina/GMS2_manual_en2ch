  <h1>Creating Sprites</h1>
  <p>Now that you <a href="What_Is_Programming_.htm">know what a program is</a>, it&#39;s time to look at some of the different <strong>assets </strong>that can be used in GameMaker Studio 2 to make your game. To start with, we&#39;ll look at <strong>sprites</strong>,
    which are generally one of the first things you&#39;ll need when making any project. As explained in the section on <a href="../Introduction/The_Asset_Browser.htm">The Asset Browser</a>, a sprite is an image that can be animated (although it doesn&#39;t
    have to be) and then drawn to the screen. In general a sprite will be associated with an object, but you can draw sprites on their own, either from code or in the room editor <strong>Asset Layer</strong> (we&#39;ll talk about this in more detail later,
    in the section on <a href="Rooms.htm">rooms</a>). You can also create a sprite to be used as a <a class="tooltip" title="A tile set is a collection of square or rectangular graphical assets laid out on a grid as a single image. Each item in the grid can then be placed multiple times in a room to create a larger scene called the &#39;tile map&#39;.">tile sets</a>, but we&#39;ll explore that option in a later section too.</p>
  <p>When you create a new project from the <a href="../Introduction/The_Start_Page.htm">Start Page</a>, the asset browser will only contain empty folders for the resources you may need, so you need to right-click <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png"/> on the sprite asset folder and then select the option <strong>Create</strong> (if you don&#39;t have a sprite asset folder you can make one from the right-click menu and then create the sprite, or you can simply right-click anywhere in the asset
    browser and create it). This will create a new sprite asset and open the <a href="../The_Asset_Editors/Sprites.htm"><strong>sprite editor</strong></a> for you (if the sprite editor does not open, simply double-click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/> on the new asset):</p>
  <p><img alt="The Sprite Editor" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_Sprites_SpriteEditor.png"/>As you can see, the top left of the window has a field for the <strong>Name </strong>of the sprite. All sprites (and all other assets) must have
    a name given to them so that you (and GameMaker Studio 2) can identify them easily, although you should note that this name is really just a <strong> <a class="tooltip" title="A variable is a named value within a program which can be modified, stored and displayed whenever required. For example, if we have an integer variable with a name XYZ and it stores a value 10, we can then do things like A = XYZ + 10, which will set the value of the variable A to 20, since XYZ is 10 and we are adding 10 to it. You can also change variable values using operators, so doing XYZ = XYZ + 100 would modify the value of our XYZ variable to be equal to 110. Variables can also be used to store identifiers and references to different assets.">variable</a></strong> which holds an ID value
    that &quot;points&quot; to the resource, in this case a sprite. It&#39;s best to give each sprite a descriptive name so that you can identify at a glance whether a particular asset is a sprite or an object or something else, and many people do this
    by prefixing or suffixing the resource with the letters &quot; <span class="inline">spr</span>&quot; - for example, &quot; <span class="inline">spr_Ball</span>&quot;. Note that resource names are limited to using only letters, digits and the underscore
    symbol &quot;_&quot;, and the name of all assets must start with a letter, not a number.</p>
  <p>The other features of the sprite editor we&#39;ll discuss at the end of this section, but first we need to explain how to draw a sprite. This is done in the <a href="../The_Asset_Editors/Image_Editor.htm"><strong>Image Editor</strong></a>. The image
    editor is a very powerful tool for creating the graphics in your game and is opened by clicking the <em>Edit Image </em>button.</p>
  <p><img alt="The Image Editor" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_Sprites_ImageEditor.png"/></p>
  <p>We won&#39;t go into too much depth about the tools available here - for that we have the Image Editor section of the manual - but briefly you have:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li>At the top left, the <strong>frame view</strong> - this shows the frame(s) of your sprite and can be resized using the magnifying glass icons.</li>
    <li>In the centre we have the drawing <strong>canvas</strong> - this shows the currently selected frame ready for drawing and you can use the middle mouse button <img alt="MMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_MMB.png" width="21"/> to pan around and the mouse wheel <img alt="MMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_MMB.png" width="21"/> to zoom in and out.</li>
    <li>At the top right we have the basic <strong>brushes</strong> - here you can pick the brush for drawing, and any custom brushes will also be added here.</li>
    <li>At the middle right we have the <strong>colour picker</strong> - here we can choose the colour to use for the left and/or right mouse button, since you can draw on the canvas with one or the other buttons at the same time.</li>
    <li>Just below the colour picker we have our <strong>tools </strong>- these are the different drawing tools, including the brush, flood fill, masking and shape tools. Note that some of the tools are split diagonally and will draw either outlined or filled
      shapes depending on which side of the line you click on to select them.</li>
    <li>At the bottom right we have the <strong>layers view</strong> - like many other drawing tools out there, you can create different layers to draw onto, permitting you to experiment with position and colour etc... without having to worry about destroying
      what&#39;s underneath.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Draw something into the image editor and take some time to play with the options, then when you are ready close the image editor workspace (which will save the image) to take you back to the main workspace with the sprite editor in it. We&#39;ll discuss
    a few other features of the sprite editor that are important to know when just getting started...</p>
  <p>The first thing you need know is how to set the <strong>origin </strong>for the sprite. The origin is simply the point that will be used to &quot;anchor&quot; our sprite within the room, and in this case we want to set it to the centre.</p>
  <p>So we click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/> on the from down menu for setting the origin and select &quot;middle centre&quot;:</p>
  <p><img alt="Example Showing The Sprite Origin" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_Sprites_SpriteOrigin.png"/></p>
  <p>You&#39;ll see the blue origin marker in the preview image move to the center of the sprite. Note that you can place the origin anywhere you wish by simply clicking <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/> on the
    preview image, and you can also manually input the origin position by adding values into the x/y fields at the top.</p>
  <p>Another important thing to do know is how to set the <strong>collision mask</strong> for the sprite. The collision mask is the area that GameMaker Studio 2 will check to see if there has been a collision with any other instance of an object in the game,
    and by default this is set to rectangle (which is also the fastest to resolve). Note that you can set the detection mode for the <strong> <a class="tooltip" title="For sprites, the bounding-box is the name given to the edges of the area that collisions will initially be detected in, and it doesn&#39;t have to be the same size as the sprite it&#39;s being applied to. For sequences, the bounding box is the outer edge of the total space that one or more assets occupy in the canvas.">bounding box</a></strong> to be either automatic
    (the default value) or manual. If you choose manual you will be able to set the bounding box values left, right, top and bottom.</p>
  <p><img alt="Example Showing The Sprite Mask" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_Sprites_SpriteMask.png"/></p>
  <p>Any type of collision mask other than rectangle will be slower to resolve, but when making a small, simple game it&#39;s not usually an issue. Note that you can also import sprites made in other software by clicking the <em>Import </em>button in the
    sprite editor, and you can also drag image files onto the GameMaker Studio 2 IDE to add them as sprites to the Asset Browser. You can also drag sprites from the Asset Browser to add them to things directly, in which case the IDE will highlight the
    places you can add the sprite to:</p>
  <p><img alt="Where To Drop A Sprite On An Object" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_DropSprite.png"/>If you&#39;d like more detailed information on the Sprite Editor and the Image Editor, please see the following sections of the manual:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><a href="../The_Asset_Editors/Sprites.htm">Editors: The Sprite Editor</a></li>
    <li><a href="../The_Asset_Editors/Image_Editor.htm">Editors: The Image Editor</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can close the sprite editor now as we are going to move on to discuss <strong> Tile Sets</strong>.</p>
