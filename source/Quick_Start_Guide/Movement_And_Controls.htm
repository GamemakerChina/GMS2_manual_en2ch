  <h1>Movement And Controls</h1>
  <p>The <a href="Drawing.htm">previous section</a> of this Quick Start Guide gave some examples for drawing things to the screen, but just drawing things isn&#39;t much good if you can&#39;t also move them around... so in this section we&#39;ll be giving
    you some examples of movement for your objects, as well as some basic control schemes for different types of games. All the examples are given using Drag and Drop™ (DnD™) as well as the GameMaker Language (GML), so you can use whichever you feel more
    comfortable with. Note that we won&#39;t be explaining things in too much depth here, as we want you to get started making stuff as quickly as possible, so we encourage you to explore any links as you go along and to use the &quot;search&quot; function
    of the manual to look for additional information on anything you aren&#39;t sure about.</p>
  <p>Before going any further, you might want to make a new project (either GML or DnD™) from the <a href="../Introduction/The_Start_Page.htm">Start Page</a>, and add (or create) a few sprites as well as an object or two - as we&#39;ll be giving you some
    code that you can test using these - and make sure that the project has a room to place instances in. Don&#39;t worry too much about what the sprites you make look like, as even a simple white square will do, and once you&#39;ve got everything ready
    you can start working on the examples listed below.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop_down" href="#"><span data-open-text="true">Move Towards The Mouse</span><span data-close-text="true">Move Towards The Mouse</span></a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down">
    <p class="dropspot">One of the simplest ways to get an object moving and interacting with the player is to use the mouse, and in this example we&#39;ll show you how to use some basic code to get an object to move towards wherever the user has clicked the left mouse button
      <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/>.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">To start with, open an object, assign it a sprite, and then give it a <strong>Global Left Mouse Down event</strong>:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Adding The Mouse Left Button Down Event" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_Add_GlobalLMBDownEvent.png"/></p>
    <p class="dropspot">We use the <strong>global </strong>mouse events because they detect a click anywhere in the room, while the regular mouse events will only detect a click if the mouse actually clicks within the instance <a class="tooltip" title="For sprites, the bounding-box is the name given to the edges of the area that collisions will initially be detected in, and it doesn&#39;t have to be the same size as the sprite it&#39;s being applied to. For sequences, the bounding box is the outer edge of the total space that one or more assets occupy in the canvas.">bounding box</a>. In this event we want to add this DnD™ or GML:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="DnD To Move Instance Towards Mouse" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_MovementExample_DnD_1_1.png"/></p>
    <p class="code">move_towards_point(mouse_x, mouse_y, 2);</p>
    <p class="dropspot">Here we are telling the instance to move towards a position on the screen, in this case the &quot;<span class="inline">mouse_x</span>&quot; and &quot;<span class="inline">mouse_y</span>&quot; position (&quot;<span class="inline">mouse_x</span>&quot;
      and &quot;<span class="inline">mouse_y</span>&quot; are <strong>built-in </strong> <a class="tooltip" title="A variable is a named value within a program which can be modified, stored and displayed whenever required. For example, if we have an integer variable with a name XYZ and it stores a value 10, we can then do things like A = XYZ + 10, which will set the value of the variable A to 20, since XYZ is 10 and we are adding 10 to it. You can also change variable values using operators, so doing XYZ = XYZ + 100 would modify the value of our XYZ variable to be equal to 110. Variables can also be used to store identifiers and references to different assets.">variable</a><span class="glossextra">s</span> that always hold the current mouse cursor position). The DnD™
      does this by setting the &quot;<span class="inline">direction</span>&quot; and &quot; <span class="inline">speed</span>&quot; <a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Instances/Instance_Variables/Instance_Variables.htm"><strong>Instance Variables</strong></a>,
      while the GML does this using the function <a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Movement_And_Collisions/Movement/move_towards_point.htm"><span class="inline">move_towards_point()</span></a> (this also sets the <span class="inline">speed </span>and
      <span class="inline">direction </span>variables, just in a single, easy to use function).</p>
    <p class="dropspot">Place an instance of this object in a room and then hit the Play button <img alt="Play Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_PlayGame.png"/>, then click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/> around
      the room to make the instance move towards the mouse:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Animation Of Instance Moving Towards Mouse" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_MovementExample_1_1.gif"/>Great! The instance of the object now moves towards where you clicked, and if you hold down the button, the instance
      will just keep following the mouse cursor. However, there is a problem... After you click once and release, the instance will keep on moving and eventually leave the room! There are a number of ways that we can fix this, and which one you choose
      will depend on what you want to do, but the easiest fix for now is to simply add a <strong>Global Mouse Button Released</strong> event, so add that now to the object and give it this code:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="DnD To Set The Instance Speed" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_MovementExample_DnD_1_2.png"/></p>
    <p class="code">speed = 0;</p>
    <p class="dropspot">With this, the instance will only follow the mouse cursor for as long as the mouse button is held down, and when you release the button it will stop moving. Press Play <img alt="Play Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_PlayGame.png"/> and test it now.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">Before we leave this example, there is one final issue that we need to resolve... If you click and <em>hold </em>the mouse button, but don&#39;t move the cursor, then the instance will move towards the cursor and then &quot;vibrate&quot; around it.
      This is because the instance is moving faster than 1 pixel at a time and so &quot;over-shoots&quot; the position and then tries to move back, and then over-shoots again, etc... (make the movement speed 5 or something like that to see the issue if
      it&#39;s not immediately obvious).</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Animation Showing Instance Vibrating" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_MovementExample_1_2.gif"/>To solve this we need to add a <strong>Step Event</strong> to the object with this code:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="DnD Actions For The Step Event" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_MovementExample_DnD_1_3.png"/></p>
    <p class="code">var _dist = point_distance(x, y, mouse_x, mouse_y);<br/> if _dist &lt;= speed<br/>     {<br/>     speed = 0;<br/>     }</p>
    <p class="dropspot">Here we just check the distance from the instance to the mouse position, and if it&#39;s the same as or less than the current speed, we set the speed to 0. This makes the instance stop when it&#39;s close enough to the mouse position, and we don&#39;t
      get that nasty &quot;vibrating&quot; issue.</p>

  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop_down1" href="#"><span data-open-text="true">4-Way and 8-Way Movement With The Keyboard</span><span data-close-text="true">4-Way and 8-Way Movement With The Keyboard</span></a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down1">
    <p class="dropspot"><a href="What_Is_Programming_.htm">Right at the start of this guide</a>, we showed you the following DnD™ and GML code to move an instance to the right by two pixels every game step:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="DnD Example" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_DnD_Example.png"/></p>
    <p class="code">x = x + 2;</p>
    <p class="dropspot">This type of movement is called <strong>positional </strong>movement, as we are essentially picking up the instance and placing it down again at a new position every time the code is run. What we&#39;re going to do in this example is show you how
      to use this type of movement to move an instance around in 4 directions: up, down, left and right.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">To start with, open an object and assign it a sprite. Now, we could add in various <strong>Keyboard Events</strong> at this point, and in each one have the instance move in the desired direction, however, we only want the player to be able to move
      in one direction at a time and doing this with only the keyboard events is a bit more complicated than doing it using code. Instead we&#39;ll be using the <strong>Step Event</strong> - which you should add now to the object - with the following
      DnD™ or GML to use the Arrow Keys to move:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="DnD Step Event Movement Actions" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_MovementExample_DnD_2_1.png"/></p>
    <p class="code">if keyboard_check(vk_left)<br/>     {<br/>     x = x - 2;<br/>     }<br/> else if keyboard_check(vk_right)<br/>     {<br/>     x = x + 2;<br/>     }<br/> else if keyboard_check(vk_up)<br/>     {<br/>     y = y - 2;<br/>     }<br/> else if keyboard_check(vk_down)<br/>          {<br/>     y = y - 2;<br/>     }</p>
    <p class="dropspot">We are using an &quot; <span class="inline">if... else if... else if...</span>&quot; structure to ensure that the instance will only move in one direction at a time, and so the instance should only be able to move up, down, left or right, but not
      diagonally. Place an instance of the object in a room and press the <strong>Play </strong>button <img alt="Play Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_PlayGame.png"/> to test it now! If all has gone correctly, you should have something
      like this:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Animation Showing 4-Way Keyboard Movement" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_MovementExample_2_1.gif"/></p>
    <p class="dropspot">We can modify this code to convert the 4-way movement into 8-way movement easily too... simply remove the &quot; <span class="inline">else</span>&quot; commands from the code blocks so that everything looks like this:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="DnD Step Event Movement Actions" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_MovementExample_DnD_2_2.png"/></p>
    <p class="code">if keyboard_check(vk_left)<br/>     {<br/>     x = x - 2;<br/>     }<br/> if keyboard_check(vk_right)<br/>     {<br/>     x = x + 2;<br/>     }<br/> if keyboard_check(vk_up)<br/>     {<br/>     y = y - 2;<br/>     }<br/> if keyboard_check(vk_down)<br/>          {<br/>     y = y - 2;<br/>     }</p>
    <p class="dropspot">Now when you press the <strong>Play </strong>button <img alt="Play Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_PlayGame.png"/> it&#39;ll look something like this:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Animation Showing 8-Way Keyboard Movement" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_MovementExample_2_2.gif"/></p>
    <p class="dropspot">One final thing that&#39;s worth noting for users coding with GML... When using the DnD™ you can select the keyboard key that you want to use from a drop down list, but with GML it&#39;s not that simple. There are a number of <a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Game_Input/Keyboard_Input/Keyboard_Input.htm">Keyboard Constants</a> that
      you can use - like the arrow key constants shown in the code above - but there are <em>no </em>constants for the alpha-numeric keys. These are handled slightly different, and require you to use the function <a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Strings/ord.htm"><span class="inline">ord()</span></a>.
      The code below shows you how this would work using WASD instead of the arrow keys:</p>
    <p class="code">if keyboard_check(ord(&quot;A&quot;))<br/>     {<br/>     x = x - 2;<br/>     }<br/> if keyboard_check(ord(&quot;D&quot;))<br/>     {<br/>     x = x + 2;<br/>     }<br/> if keyboard_check(ord(&quot;W&quot;))<br/>     {<br/>     y = y - 2;<br/>   }<br/>      if keyboard_check(ord(&quot;S&quot;))<br/>     {<br/>     y = y - 2;<br/>     }</p>
    <p class="dropspot"> </p>
  </div>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop_down2" href="#"><span data-open-text="true">Gamepad Movement</span><span data-close-text="true">Gamepad Movement</span></a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down2">
    <p class="dropspot">We&#39;ve covered mouse movement and keyboard movement, so that means it&#39;s time to cover <strong>gamepad </strong>movement. Now, we won&#39;t be covering the d-pad, as really that works just like using the keyboard (simply change the keyboard
      functions in the above example for <a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Game_Input/GamePad_Input/gamepad_button_check.htm"><span class="inline">gamepad_button_check()</span></a> or <a href="../Drag_And_Drop/Drag_And_Drop_Reference/Gamepad/If_Gamepad_Button_Down.htm">If Gamepad button Down</a>),
      so in this example we&#39;ll look at using the analog stick for movement.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">To start with, we need to detect the gamepad being used. Gamepads are given an ID value from 0 to 11, so we will use a &quot; <span class="inline">for</span>&quot; loop to detect the ID of any connected gamepads and store this ID value in a variable
      for future use. Since we only want to setect the first gamepad that is connected and not all of them, we will use the &quot; <span class="inline">break</span>&quot; command after we detect a gamepad so that the it &quot;breaks&quot; the loop (for
      example, if the first gamepad connected is ID 4, then the loop will only run 5 times, checking the ID values 0 - 4 and then breaking out of the loop when the gamepad is encountered). So, make (or open) an object, assign it a sprite, and then add
      a <strong>Create Event</strong> with the following:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Getting Gamepad ID Using DnD" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_MovementExample_DnD_3_1.png"/></p>
    <p class="code">gamepad_id = -1;<br/> for (var i = 0; i &lt; 12; i += 1;)<br/>     {<br/>     if gamepad_is_connected(i)<br/>         {<br/>         gamepad_id = i;<br/>         gamepad_set_axis_deadzone(gamepad_id, 0.2);<br/>         break;<br/>         }<br/> }
    </p>
    <p class="dropspot">Notice that in the above code we set the <strong> <a class="tooltip" title="The deadzone is the distance you have to move an analog stick before the game recognizes it&#39;s being moved. A low deadzone will make any slight movement of the analog stick move your player or aim or whatever. A high deadzone value means that the analog stick needs a much greater movement before the game will detect it and move whatever is being controlled.">deadzone</a> </strong>for the gamepad. This is because analog sticks on different makes of gamepads will have different sensibility, and sometimes
      they can be so sensitive that if you don&#39;t set a deadzone then they can cause unwanted movement in your games. So we set the deadzone to a value like 0.2 to tell GameMaker Studio 2 to ignore any gamepad stick values under that <a class="tooltip" title="An absolute value is one where the sign of the value is ignored, essentially converting all values into positive ones or zero. So - for example - an absolute value for -10 would be 10.">absolute</a> value.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">To add the actual movement, we&#39;ll need a <strong>Step Event</strong>, so add that now and give it the following DnD™ or GML:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Get Gamepad Input Using DnD" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_MovementExample_DnD_3_2.png"/></p>
    <p class="code">if gamepad_id &gt; -1<br/>     {<br/>     var _h = gamepad_axis_value(gamepad_id, gp_axislh);<br/>     var _v = gamepad_axis_value(gamepad_id, gp_axislv);<br/>     x += _h * 4;<br/>     y += _v * 4;<br/>     }</p>
    <p class="dropspot">Here we are checking the <em>left </em>stick for horizontal or vertical movement. The axis functions return a value between -1 and 1, so for the horizontal axis -1 is left, 0 is not moving and 1 is right, and for the vertical axis it&#39;s -1 for
      up, 0 for not moving and 1 for down. Note too that the values are <em>between </em>-1 and 1, so - for example - the horizontal axis could return a value of 0.5, meaning the stick is halfway between the &quot;rest&quot; position and fully pushed
      to the right. For that reason, we then multiply the value by 4 (you can multiply by any value really, depending on the speed you want the instance to move) - it means that the speed of the instance will vary depending on how much of a movement has
      been made on the stick axis.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">Place an instance of this object in a room and pres the press <strong>Play </strong>button <strong> <img alt="Play Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_PlayGame.png"/></strong>, then move around using the left stick of your connected
      gamepad. You should see something like this:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Animation Showing Gamepad Movement" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_MovementExample_3_1.gif"/></p>
    <p class="dropspot"> </p>
  </div>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop_down3" href="#"><span data-open-text="true">Advanced 8-Way Movement</span><span data-close-text="true">Advanced 8-Way Movement</span></a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down3">
    <p class="dropspot">In this final example, we&#39;re going to re-visit our 8-way movement code and address an issue it has, which is that diagonal movement is actually faster than up/down/left/right movement. This is simply because when moving diagonally, you are moving
      along the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle created by the x/y movement values:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Image Showing Why Diagonal Movement Is Faster" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_MovementExample_4_1.png"/></p>
    <p class="dropspot">To make it clearer what&#39;s happening, let&#39;s remove all the text and sprites and simply show the same line of movement roated 45° so it&#39;s horizontal:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Simplified Image SHowing Diaginal Movement Is Faster" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_MovementExample_4_2.png"/></p>
    <p class="dropspot">As you can see, the difference is pretty obvious, and if the instance moves more than 1 or 2 pixels per step, then it becomes very noticiable that diagonal movement is <em>much </em>faster! So how do we limit this? There are a number of ways to go
      about this, but we&#39;re going to concentrate on just one of them, because it introduces a couple of functions and concepts that will be useful to you later on in your games.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">To deal with this, we are going to have to store the input values from the keys pressed independently in <a class="tooltip" title="A variable is a named value within a program which can be modified, stored and displayed whenever required. For example, if we have an integer variable with a name XYZ and it stores a value 10, we can then do things like A = XYZ + 10, which will set the value of the variable A to 20, since XYZ is 10 and we are adding 10 to it. You can also change variable values using operators, so doing XYZ = XYZ + 100 would modify the value of our XYZ variable to be equal to 110. Variables can also be used to store identifiers and references to different assets.">variable</a><span class="glossextra">s</span>, and then check them and move according
      to the combination of keys that have been pressed. So, for this you&#39;ll need an object with a sprite assigned, and you&#39;ll need to give it a <strong>Step Event</strong> with the following DnD™ or GML:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="DnD Step Event Actions To Define Movement Variables" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_MovementExample_DnD_4_1.png"/></p>
    <p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong>: We&#39;ve split the DnD™ above over two columns to make it easier to visualise, but in the DnD™ editor, it will be placed consecutively.</p>
    <p class="code">var _left = keyboard_check(vk_left);<br/> var _right = keyboard_check(vk_right);<br/> var _up = keyboard_check(vk_up);<br/> var _down = keyboard_check(vk_down);<br/> var _hspd = _right - _left;<br/> var _vspd = _down - _up;</p>
    <p class="dropspot">We&#39;ll need to add some more code to actually move, but before we do, let&#39;s just explain this a bit. We want to convert left/right/up/down into equivalent horizontal and vertical speed values, so to do that we are getting the value of each
      key and then doing some basic maths on it to get the speed values. This works because if a key is being pressed then the check action or function will return &quot;1&quot;, and if it&#39;s <em>not </em>being pressed, then the function will return
      0. So, if - for example - right is being pressed, you have &quot;1 - 0 = 1&quot; for the &quot; <span class="inline">_hspd</span>&quot;, and if left is being pressed you have &quot;0 - 1 = -1&quot; for the &quot; <span class="inline">_hspd</span>&quot;
      (and if they both get pressed then it&#39;s &quot;1 - 1 = 0&quot;, so the instance won&#39;t move). Remember, in a GameMaker Studio 2 room, to move right we add to the <span class="inline">x </span>position and to move left we subtract, so this
      code will give us a positive or negative value that we can add or subtract to move horizontally or vertically depending on the keyboard input.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">Now we can add the code that actually moves the instance, so - still in the <strong>Step Event</strong>, and after the above code - add this:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="DnD Step Event Actions To Move The Instance" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_MovementExample_DnD_4_2.png"/></p>

    <p class="dropspot">The above code first checks to see if one of two <a class="tooltip" title="An expression is a combination of one or more constants, variables, operators, and/or functions that are interpreted according to particular rules of precedence and association to return another value. A simple expression would be (5 + 5), which returns 10.">expression</a><span class="glossextra">s</span> is true, ie: if the horizontal or vertical speed variables are not 0. Note how the &quot;
      <span class="inline">if</span>&quot; GML check uses the symbol &quot; <span class="inline">||</span>&quot;. This means &quot; <span class="inline">or</span>&quot; when programming, so - in plain language - you are checking</p>
    <p class="code">if the variable _hspd does not equal zero <strong>or </strong>if the variable _vspd does not qual zero</p>
    <p class="dropspot">You can string multiple expressions together in &quot; <span class="inline">if</span>&quot; checks in this way, and there are multiple different ways those expressions can be evaluated (for more information please see the section on <strong>Expressions</strong>      <a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Expressions_And_Operators.htm">here</a>).</p>
    <p class="dropspot">The next section of code stores a value for the actual movement speed in a variable and then gets a direction using the <span class="inline">_hspd </span>and <span class="inline">_vspd </span>values, which can be -1, 0, or 1. The direction function
      checks from (0, 0) as we aren&#39;t using room coordinates, and instead we want it to evaluate as a direction from 0° to 360° based on the variable values. The following diagram illustrates what&#39;s happening better than trying to explain it in
      words:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Example Image Showing Direction Around (0,0) Origin" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_MovementExample_4_3.png"/></p>
    <p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong>: Direction in GameMaker Studio 2 is calculated <strong>counter clockwise</strong>, so 0° and 360° are to the right, 90° is up, 180° is to the right and 270° is down.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">Finally, we use the <a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Maths_And_Numbers/Angles_And_Distance/lengthdir_x.htm"><span class="inline">lengthdir_x()</span></a> and <a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Maths_And_Numbers/Angles_And_Distance/lengthdir_y.htm"><span class="inline">lengthdir_y()</span></a> functions
      to actually move the variable. These are <strong> <a class="tooltip" title="A vector is a mathematical construct that has a size, called the magnitude, and a direction. In GameMaker, a vector is usually used to show the distance and direction something moved in. A vector can also be used to define images and certain image formats like SWF use vector maths to define the images they contain.">vector</a>  </strong>functions that take a length (distance) and a direction and then calculate the new position on the given axis based on these
      values (see the function descriptions for a more in-depth explanation).</p>
    <p class="dropspot">That&#39;s a lot to take in at once, and don&#39;t worry if you don&#39;t quite understand it all! You will in time! All that&#39;s left to do now is add an instance of this object to a room, and then press the <strong>Play </strong>button <strong> <img alt="Play Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_PlayGame.png"/></strong>,
      and you should get silky-smooth 8 way movement without any of the issues related to moving diagonally:</p>
