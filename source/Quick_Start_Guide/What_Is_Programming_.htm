  <h1>What Is Programming?</h1>
  <p>In the <a href="Quick_Start_Guide.htm">previous section</a>, we outlined how GameMaker Studio 2 works to create your game, but regardless of the sprites, objects or rooms that you have added, nothing will happen unless you have <strong>programmed </strong>it
    to happen. But, what is a program?</p>
  <p>In the general sense, a program is simply a set of instructions (or <strong> <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="statement" href="#">statement</a></strong><span class="glossextra">s</span>) that you give to the computer to tell it to perform certain
    tasks. These tasks can vary greatly from simply telling the computer to draw something to the screen, to calculating a value based on some user input and then reacting to it, but in all cases it&#39;s a logical structure that will give some result.
    In the previous page we talked about moving an instance of an object to the right by 2 pixels, so let&#39;s have a look at the actual program that would do that:</p>
  <p>In Drag And Drop™ (DnD™) it would look like this:</p>
  <p><img alt="DnD Example" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_DnD_Example.png" /></p>
  <p>And using the GameMaker Language (GML) it would look like this:</p>
  <p class="code">x = x + 2;</p>
  <p>To understand what&#39;s going on above, we must first talk about <strong>Variables</strong>, and then we&#39;ll go on to discuss <strong>Functions </strong>and finally <strong>Conditionals </strong>as these three things are generally what makes up
    the bulk of any program.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop_down" href="What_Is_Programming_.htm#">Variables</a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down">
    <p class="dropspot">Variables are the cornerstone of programing, along with <strong>functions </strong>(which we&#39;ll cover briefly in a moment). A variable is simply a <em>named value</em>, and in the case above the variable is called &quot;<span class="inline">x</span>&quot;.
      Now, &quot;<span class="inline">x</span>&quot; can be any value, like -126, or 583, or even 1.56378, but the actual value of &quot;<span class="inline">x</span>&quot; is irrelevant as it can vary (hence the name &quot;variable&quot;). What is important
      is that we take &quot;<span class="inline">x</span>&quot; and add 2 to it. It&#39;s worth noting that in this case &quot;<span class="inline">x</span>&quot; is a <strong>built-in variable</strong>, which means that it&#39;s a variable that is create
      by GameMaker Studio 2 for all objects, but you can create your own variables too.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">To create a variable, it must be <strong>declared </strong>before it can be used. Declaring a variable is telling GameMaker Studio 2 that this new variable exists and it has an initial value. To decalre a variable you would simply do something like
      this:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Declare DnD Variables" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_DnD_Declare.png" /></p>
    <p class="dropspot">or:</p>
    <p class="code">points = 0;</p>
    <p class="dropspot">Once a variable has been declared, then it can be used in further programed code or actions. The great thing about variables is that it permits you to &quot;re-use&quot; a value in multiple places, without actually having to worry about what the value
      is. For example, say you have a &quot;<span class="inline">damage</span>&quot; variable and you use it in various places to tell GameMaker Studio 2 to deal a certain amount of damage to other objects in the game. We may declare &quot;<span class="inline">damage</span>&quot;
      as 20, but later on decide that this is too great a value and want to change it to 10. If we&#39;d used the value 20 instead of a variable, we&#39;d need to go through all our code or actions and change 20 to 10, which is time consuming and error
      prone. However, using a variable means we only have to change it <em>once </em>to 10 when we declare it and the rest of the code or actions will use this new value.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">It is worth noting that there are many different types of variables, and each one has slightly different ways it can be used. We won&#39;t be covering this here, but you can find out more information from the <a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Variables_And_Variable_Scope.htm">GameMaker Language Overview</a>      section of the manual.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">However, variables are only the first part of the story. The next part is the use of Functions...</p>
    <p class="dropspot"> </p>
  </div>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop_down1" href="What_Is_Programming_.htm#">Functions</a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down1">
    <p class="dropspot">The next main important part of programing is the use of <strong>functions </strong>along with variables. A function is simply an instruction to the computer to do something, and it can have input values as well as output values (ie: you can give
      a value to it, and it will do some operation and then return a different value), although not all functions require input, nor do they have an output. To better understand this, let&#39;s look at a built-in function in GameMaker Studio 2.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">The function we&#39;ll look at is <a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Instances/instance_number.htm"><span class="inline">instance_number()</span></a>, which in DnD™ is the <a href="../Drag_And_Drop/Drag_And_Drop_Reference/Instance/Get_Instance_Count.htm">Get Instance Count</a> action.
      This function/action will retrieve the number of instances of a given object in the game room, and you would use it like this:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Get Instance Count DnD Action" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_DnD_GetInstanceCount.png" /></p>
    <p class="dropspot">or:</p>
    <p class="code">number = instance_number(obj_Enemy);</p>
    <p class="dropspot">In both of the above examples, the function takes an object ID as its input value (the <strong> <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="argument" href="#">argument</a></strong> or <strong>parameter</strong>) and will give an output value (the <strong>return </strong>value),
      which is the number of instances of the given object present in the room when the function/action was called. Note that we use a variable to store the returned value, the variable &quot;<span class="inline">number</span>&quot;. This variable can
      be declared before this code is run, or it will be considered as being declared when the code is run and the return value from the function/action assigned to it.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">It is worth noting that you are not just limited to using the built in GameMaker Language or DnD™ actions and you can actually construct your own functions to use to extend what is possible when programming (you can find out more about this <a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Script_Functions.htm">here</a>      for GML and <a href="../Drag_And_Drop/Drag_And_Drop_Overview/Action_Block_Functions.htm">here</a> for DnD™).</p>
    <p class="dropspot">You can do a lot with functions and variables, however they would be pretty much useless without the final important piece of the programming story, <strong>conditionals</strong>...</p>
    <p class="dropspot"> </p>
  </div>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop_down2" href="What_Is_Programming_.htm#">Conditionals</a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down2">
    <p class="dropspot">A large part of programming is made up of asking questions. These questions are generally simple ones that can evaluate to either true or false, and are called <strong>conditionals </strong>(and the values of <span class="inline">true </span>and
      <span
        class="inline">false </span>are called <strong>boolean </strong>values). The most common and widely used conditional is the question &quot;<span class="inline">if</span>&quot;, which is used to check if something is <span class="inline">true </span>or <span class="inline">false </span>and
        then act accordingly. A simple example would be removing a character from the game if their health goes below zero, which in plain language would be expressed as:</p>
    <p class="code">if the character variable &quot;hp&quot; is less than or equal to zero, then destroy it.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">To make the above into code we&#39;d have this:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="DnD Conditional" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_DnD_Conditional.png" /></p>
    <p class="dropspot">or:</p>
    <p class="code">if (hp &lt;= 0)<br/>
      <br/>     {<br/>
      <br/>     instance_destroy();<br/>
      <br/>     }</p>
    <p class="dropspot">So, above we ask the question &quot;if the hp variable is less than or equal to 0&quot; and then if that evaluates to true we call the function <a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Instances/instance_destroy.htm"><span class="inline">instance_destroy()</span></a> or
      the action <a href="../Drag_And_Drop/Drag_And_Drop_Reference/Instance/Destroy_Object_Instance.htm">Destroy Object Instance</a>. Note that the &quot;<span class="inline">then</span>&quot; (if something... then something...) is <em>implicit </em>and
      you don&#39;t need to add it, and also note that in the GML code we use braces <span class="inline">{} </span>to &quot;block off&quot; the code we want to be executed when the &quot; <span class="inline">if</span>&quot; evaluates to <span class="inline">true </span>(in
      DnD™ this is symbolised by dropping the actions to the <em>right </em>of the &quot;<span class="inline">If</span>&quot; action). Anything added between the braces will only run if the &quot; <span class="inline">if</span>&quot; evaluates to
      <span
        class="inline">true</span>, so you can have more than one statement run in a single &quot;block&quot;.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">One more thing to note when using the &quot;<span class="inline">if</span>&quot; conditional is that we can add an &quot;<span class="inline">else</span>&quot; statement to it too, so the conditional would then become &quot;if something evaluates
      to <span class="inline">true </span>then do something, <em>else </em>do something different&quot;. In this way way can deal with a conditional expression returning <span class="inline">true </span> <em>or </em> <span class="inline">false</span>.
      Let&#39;s give an example of that too:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="DnD If... Else.. Example" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_DnD_IfElse.png" /></p>
    <p class="dropspot">or:</p>
    <p class="code">if (countdown &lt;= 0)<br/>
      <br/>     {<br/>
      <br/>     instance_create_layer(x, y, &quot;Instances&quot;, obj_Bullet);<br/>
      <br/>     countdown = 30;<br/>
      <br/>     }<br/>
      <br/> else
      <br/>
      <br/>     {<br/>
      <br/>     countdown = countdown - 1;<br/>
      <br/>     }</p>
    <p class="dropspot">The above code translates into plain language as:</p>
    <p class="code">if the countdown variable is less than or equal to zero then:<br/>
      <br/>     create an instance of the object &quot;obj_Bullet&quot; at the current x/y position on the layer &quot;instances&quot;,<br/>
      <br/>     reset the countdown variable to 30.<br/>
      <br/> else:
      <br/>
      <br/>     subtract one from the countdown variable.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">Don&#39;t worry too much about the actual instance creation part of the above code, as we&#39;ll cover that in more detail in the following sections. The important thing to understand here is that you can create conditional expressions that check
      if something is <span class="inline">true </span>or <span class="inline">false </span>and have your program respond in different ways. This may seem a very simple thing, but it&#39;s actually incredibly powerful and will form the basis for almost
      everything you do when programming in GameMaker Studio 2.</p>
  </div>
  <p> </p>
  <p>So, to answer our question of &quot;What is programming?&quot;, we can say that <strong>programming </strong>is using a combination of <strong>statements  </strong>- which can use <strong> <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="variable" href="#">variable</a></strong>
    <span
      class="glossextra">s</span><strong> </strong>to form <strong> <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="expression" href="#">expression</a></strong><span class="glossextra">s</span>, <strong>functions </strong>to perform tasks, and <strong><a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="conditional" href="#">conditional</a></strong>
      <span
        class="glossextra">s</span> to ask questions - and then run these statements concurrently to achieve an objective. Below you can see a slightly more complex program in DnD™ and GML. Can you guess what it does?</p>
  <p><img alt="DnD Final Code Example" class="center" src="../assets/Images/QS_Guide/QS_DnD_FinalCode.png" /></p>
  <p>or:</p>
  <p class="code">if mouse_check_button_pressed(mb_left) == true<br/>
    <br/>     {<br/>
    <br/>     x = mouse_x<br/>
    <br/>     y = mouse_y<br/>
    <br/>     image_blend = c_red;<br/>
    <br/>     }<br/>
    <br/> else
    <br/>
    <br/>     {<br/>
    <br/>     if mouse_check_button_released(mb_left) == true<br/>
    <br/>         {<br/>
    <br/>         image_blend = c_white;<br/>
    <br/>         }<br/>
    <br/>     }</p>
  <p><a class="expandspot" data-rhwidget="ExpandSpot" data-target="expanding" href="What_Is_Programming_.htm#">Spoiler</a><span class="expandtext" data-targetname="expanding">The above code first checks for a mouse button being pressed (the <strong>left </strong>mouse button, which is defined using the constant &quot; <span class="inline">mb_left</span>&quot;),
    and if it has been pressed, then it moves the instance running the code to the current mouse position (defined using the built-in variables &quot; <span class="inline">mouse_x</span>&quot; and &quot; <span class="inline">mouse_y</span>&quot;) and
    also sets the instance blend colour to <strong>red</strong>. If the mouse button has not been pressed, then it checks to see if the mouse button has been <strong>released</strong>, and if it has it resets the instance blend colour to white (note that
    again, we use some built-in <strong>constants </strong>- &quot; <span class="inline">c_red</span>&quot; and &quot; <span class="inline">c_white</span>&quot; - to define the colours easily).</span>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Hopefully you&#39;ll now have a bit more of an idea of what programming is all about, so let&#39;s move on to explore the GameMaker Studio 2 <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="IDE" href="#">IDE</a> and see how to add assets like <em>sprites </em>and
    <em>objects </em>and other important resources that your game will need.</p>
