  <h1>Constants</h1>
  <p>A constant is a type of variable that is set once at the start of the game and then never changes. In fact, constant values <em>cannot be changed after they have been declared</em>. This makes them ideal for holding values that are used throughout the
    game to identify special data.</p>
  <p>In the GameMaker Language there are two types of user-defined constant: <strong>macros</strong> and <strong>enums</strong>, both of which are explained below. Also note that any value that is always the same is classed as a constant, regardless of the
    <a href="../Data_Types.htm">data type</a>, for example, a string or the number 3.</p>
  <p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong>: The GameMaker Language also has a number of built-in constant values that are used to identify specific things. These are outlined on the appropriate pages for the runtime functions that require them in the <a href="../../GML_Reference/GML_Reference.htm">GML Reference</a>    section.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h2>Macros</h2>
  <p>While not exactly variables, macros are similar to them in how they are used, ie: they are named values that you can use throughout your code to replace <a class="tooltip" title="In computer programming, the term hard-coded is used to describe code that is considered fixed and not likely to change. Hardcoded features are built into hardware or software in such a way that they cannot be modified later on. For example, if you are making a game and &#39;hard-code&#39; the player health to 10, then you would be using the value 10 throughout the game code rather than using a variable.">hard-coded</a> values. Basically, a macro
    is a named variable that holds a constant single value of any <a href="../Data_Types.htm">data type</a>. You can define your own macros using the <a href="../Script_Functions.htm">Script Editor</a> and then use them in your code and DnD™ as if they
    were regular variables, with the one difference being that they <i>can&#39;t be changed in the game</i>.</p>
  <p>The syntax structure for a macro is as follows:</p>
  <p class="code">#macro <i>&lt;variable&gt;</i> <i>&lt;value&gt;</i></p>
  <p>For example say you define the following macro &quot;<span class="inline">total_weapons</span>&quot; (note the preceding &quot;<span class="inline">#</span>&quot; and the lack of a colon &quot;<span class="inline">;</span>&quot; at the end):</p>
  <p class="code">#macro total_weapons 10</p>
  <p>You would then call this in your code like this:</p>
  <p class="code">if ++pos == total_weapons<br/>     {
    <br/>     pos = 0;<br/>     }
  </p>
  <p>Note that you would not be able to change the constant value, so code like this will cause the game to crash:</p>
  <p class="code">total_weapons = 11;</p>
  <p>You can define a macro anywhere in your code or in a script and it will be <i>pre-compiled</i> and included in your game as if it was there from the start, but we recommend that you create a dedicated script asset and define all your macros in there.
    It will be easier to organise and debug later!</p>
  <p>If you need the value of a macro to change at run-time then you should probably make it a <a href="Global_Variables.htm">global variable</a>, since these can be changed from code during a game, unless you set the macro to be a<span> <a href="../Runtime_Functions.htm">runtime </a></span>    <a href="../Runtime_Functions.htm">function</a>. By setting the macro to a function it means that this function will be called every time you use the macro. For example:</p>
  <p class="code">#macro col make_colour_hsv(irandom(255), 255, 255)</p>
  <p>You would then call this macro something like this:</p>
  <p class="code">image_blend = col;</p>
  <p>Using this code will make the image blend a different colour every time the macro is used. It is worth noting that you can also split macros over multiple lines using the <span class="inline"><tt>\</tt></span> character to show where the line breaks.
    An example would be something like:</p>
  <p class="code">#macro hello show_debug_message(&quot;Hello&quot; + \<br/> string(player_name) + \<br/> &quot;, how are you today?&quot;);</p>
  <p>This is purely cosmetic, in that splitting a macro like this will have no effect over the result of the final macro when used, and is simply to provide support for multi-line text on macros that have longer lines of code.</p>
  <p>One very important feature of macros is that they can be defined for use with specific <a href="../../../Settings/Configurations.htm">Configurations</a> (configs), meaning you can have the same macro name but give it different values based on the currently
    selected config. For example, say you have a configuration for Android Ads and another for iOS Ads, then you could define a single macro to hold the required app ID value:</p>
  <p class="code">#macro ad_id &quot;&quot;;<br/> #macro Android:ad_id &quot;com.yoyogames.googlegame&quot;<br/> #macro iOS:ad_id &quot;com.yoyogames.appstoregame&quot;</p>
  <p>As you can see, you give the config name first then a colon <span class="inline">:</span> and then the macro name and value. Note that you cannot have any white-space between the colon <span class="inline">:</span> and either the config name nor the
    macro name otherwise you will get an error.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h2>Enums</h2>
  <p>An enum is an &quot;enumerator&quot;, and it essentially permits you to create your own limited data type with a list of constant values, and they have the following structure:</p>
  <p class="code">enum <i>&lt;variable&gt; </i>{<br/>
    <i>&lt;constant&gt;</i> [= <i>&lt;value&gt;</i>],<br/>
    <i>&lt;constant&gt;</i> [= <i>&lt;value&gt;</i>],<br/> // etc...<br/> }
  </p>
  <p>In the following example, we create an enum for the colours of the rainbow and assign it various constants and default values:</p>
  <p class="code">enum rainbowcolours {<br/>     red,<br/>     orange,<br/>     yellow,<br/>     green,<br/>     blue,<br/>     indigo,<br/>     violet<br/>     }</p>
  <p>The enum entries can only be <b>integer numbers</b> or <b><a class="tooltip" title="An expression is a combination of one or more constants, variables, operators, and/or functions that are interpreted according to particular rules of precedence and association to return another value. A simple expression would be (5 + 5), which returns 10.">expression</a><span class="glossextra">s</span> with previous enums that evaluate to an integer number</b>, and by default are numbered
    from 0 upwards, so our example given above would default to <tt>red = 0</tt>, <tt>orange = 1</tt>, <tt>yellow = 2</tt>, etc...</p>
  <p>You can also assign values to the enum variables at the time of creation:</p>
  <p class="code">enum enum_test {<br/> val = 10;<br/> }
    <br/>
    <br/> enum rainbowcolours {<br/>     red = 5,<br/>     orange = 5 * 2,<br/>     yellow = 15,<br/>     green = 20,<br/>     blue = 25,<br/>     indigo = 30,<br/>     violet = 35 * enum_test.val<br/>     }</p>
  <p>Notice in the above example we use another enum to create an expression for &quot;violet&quot;. This only works if the enum being referenced was created <i>before</i> the enum that is using it in an expression, but it will not work for variables or
    functions, since the enum value must be able to be evaluated as a constant when the project is <a class="tooltip" title="Compiling is when GameMaker takes your code and collects it together in such a way as to create an executable package that will run on a device as a game.">Compiling</a>. Also note that all enum values evaluate to <b>integer</b> values, and when you create
    your own you should be aware that <i>only integer values are permitted</i> for enums to work. This value can be any integer number that a floating point double precision number can represent, including negative values.</p>
  <p>To later access the value within a given enum type, you can use the point <tt>&quot;.&quot;</tt> method, like this:</p>
  <p class="code">variable = &lt;enum_name&gt;.&lt;<em>enum_variable</em>&gt;;</p>
  <p>As an example, let&#39;s use the &quot;<span class="inline">rainbowcolours</span>&quot; enum that we created in the code above:</p>
  <p class="code">colour_value = rainbowcolours.green * rainbowcolours.red;</p>
  <p>The <span class="inline">colour_value</span> variable would now hold the value 100 (20 * 5).</p>
  <p>Note that you <em>cannot </em>modify the values for any enum constant after it has been created, much the same as you can&#39;t modify macros after they have been created.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h2>Built-In Constants</h2>
  <p>The following table shows a list of the built-in constants that can be returned by some functions and operations in your projects:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Constant</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="inline">pointer_null</span></td>
        <td>This constant indicates that the pointer is not pointing to anything meaningful (the same as<span> </span><tt>NULL</tt><span> </span>in C++ or null in C#)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="inline">pointer_invalid</span></td>
        <td>This constant simply means that the value is not a valid pointer</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="inline">undefined</span></td>
        <td>This constant is returned when a function has to return <em>something</em> but has no appropriate or &quot;correct&quot; value to return</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="inline">NaN</span></td>
        <td><span>This constant that can be returned when the compiler cannot evaluate the results of an operation as a number - for example, 0 / 0 cannot be defined as a real number, and is therefore represented by </span><tt>NaN</tt></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="inline">infinity</span></td>
        <td><tt><span data-highlight-container="true"><span data-highlight="true"><font face="open_sansregular"><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 400;">This constant </span></font></span></span></tt><span>refers to a number that is considered infinite, such as the result you would get when dividing any floating point value by zero, eg: 1.0/0.</span></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="inline">true</span></td>
        <td>This constant represents the value 1, which is what GameMaker Studio will evaluate as a boolean &quot;true&quot; (note that any value equal to or greater than 1 will evaluate as <span class="inline">true</span>).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="inline">false</span></td>
        <td>This constant represents the value 0, which is what GameMaker Studio will evaluate as a boolean &quot;false&quot; (note that any value less than or equal to 0 will evaluate as <span class="inline">false</span>).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="inline">pi</span></td>
        <td>This constant represents the value of pi: 3.141592653589793280 etc... although the exact value will depend on various factors like the OS or the platform being targeted.</td>
      </tr>
