  <h1>The Script Editor</h1>
  <p><img alt="The Script Editor" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Scripts.png" />This section deals with the <strong>script editor</strong> (also called the <strong>text editor</strong>) which is where you type in all the code that
    your game will require to run. This editor is used for creating custom script assets, as well as for coding <a href="Object_Properties/Object_Events.htm">object events</a>, for adding <a href="Room_Properties/Room_Properties.htm">room creation code</a>,
    and for many other things, and as such, this section simply details how the script editor works, and <em>not</em> how to create script assets nor how to use Drag and Drop™ to make scripts. For that please see the following sections: </p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Script_Functions.htm">GML Scripts</a></li>
    <li><a href="../Drag_And_Drop/Drag_And_Drop_Overview/Action_Block_Functions.htm">DnD™ Scripts</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The script editor is where you write your GameMaker Language code, which is the built-in programming language that GameMaker Studio 2 uses (see the <a href="../GameMaker_Language/GameMaker_Language_Index.htm">GML Reference</a> section for more details).
    Once you become more familiar with GameMaker Studio 2 and want to use it to its fullest extent, it is advisable to start learning to use this language, as it greatly expands your possibilities when creating games.</p>
  <p>A script asset can be named by right-clicking <img alt="RMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" width="21" /> on it in the <a href="../Introduction/The_Asset_Browser.htm">Asset Browser</a> and selecting <em>Rename</em>,
    but note that the script name must conform to the scripting rules for functions, so they can only be alpha-numeric, must start with a letter, and the only symbol they can contain is the &quot;_&quot; under-bar symbol. The script editor in other places
    cannot be renamed and will have a name specific to what is being edited, like an object event for example.</p>
  <p>When you open the script editor window it will have the following options and layout:</p>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down" href="#">Script / Event Tab</a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down">
    <p class="dropspot">The script editor opens in a window with tabs across the top to let you have multiple scripts or events in one window (although this behaviour can be changed from the <a href="../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/Text_Editor_Preferences.htm">Preferences</a>      to give a new window to each script or event). You can click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21" /> on a tab and then drag it to change the tab order, or - if you prefer - you can pull
      it out of the current window and place it on the workspace to create a new window for that script (or add it to a different window), and you can also maximise the script editor to create a new workspace too. If you drag a script tab out of the
      <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="IDE" href="#">IDE</a> window, then a new IDE will be spawned to hold this script resource, and it can be used as you would the Main window.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">Note that if you are editing code from an <strong>object event </strong>in the script editor and you have maximised the script editor or have it on a separate window or workspace, then the right-click <img alt="RMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png"
        width="21" /> editor menu will have some extra options:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Script Editor RMB Object Menu" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Scripts_RMB_Object_Menu.png" /></p>
    <ul class="dropspotlist">
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Restore to workspace</strong>: This will take the script editor out of a maximised/workspace state and re-chain it to the object in the workspace.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Go to Object</strong>: This will take you to the workspace that the object with the code is on and focus on the object.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Add /Open Event</strong>: This permits you to add a new event to the object the current script belongs to, and will open a new code tab in the Script Editor for the added event. If the event selected already has code in it, then this will
        be opened in a new tab.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="dropspot">For information on the rest of the right-click <img alt="RMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" width="21" /> menu options, see the section on <strong>Editing</strong>, below.</p>
    <p class="dropspot"> </p>
  </div>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down1" href="#">Gutter</a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down1">
    <p class="dropspot">The <strong>Gutter </strong>is used to show the line numbers for your code and also to convey some specific pieces of information about the state of the code. Most importantly, if you make a <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="typo" href="#">typo</a>      or construct the code incorrectly, then the GameMaker Studio 2 <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="IDE" href="#">IDE</a> will inform you of the issue by flagging the line of code with a red exclamation mark <img alt="Code Error Icon" height="17"
        src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_CodeError.png" width="18" /> showing a <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="syntax" href="#">syntax</a> error. You can then mouse over the symbol to get a brief description of what the issue is:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Script Editor Syntax Error" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Scripts_Errors.png" />You can find more information on Syntax errors (and general errors when testing or compiling your code) from the following section:</p>
    <ul class="dropspotlist">
      <li class="dropspot"><a href="../Additional_Information/Error_Reporting.htm">Error Reporting</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="dropspot">The gutter will also mark any line of the script that has had a <strong>breakpoint </strong>added. A breakpoint is simply a place in the script where you want the <a href="../IDE_Tools/The_Debugger.htm">debugger</a> to pause the execution of your
      game when it is reached. You can toggle a breakpoint from any line of any script or object event by pressing &quot;<span class="inline">f9</span>&quot; or using the right-click <img alt="RMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png"
        width="21" /> menu. When you add a breakpoint, it will show up like this in the gutter:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Script Editor Breakpoint Marker" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Scripts_Breakpoint.png" />Finally, the gutter will also show any bookmarked items too. To bookmark a line of code simply hold down <img alt="Control Icon"
        class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55" /> / <img alt="CMD Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55" /> + <img alt="Shift Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Shift.png"
        width="55" /> + <span class="inline">Number</span> (from 0 to 9), and this will permit you to skip back to this line of code from anywhere in the IDE simply by using <img alt="Control Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png"
        width="55" /> / <img alt="CMD Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55" /> + <span class="inline">Number</span> (from 0 to 9). To delete the bookmark, simply perform the same action as you used to add it
      on the line of code again. When a bookmark has been added, it will show like this:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Script Editor Bookmark Marker" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Scripts_Bookmark.png" /></p>
    <p class="dropspot"> </p>
  </div>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down2" href="#">Search / Replace</a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down2">
    <p class="dropspot">While working in the script editor, you can press <img alt="Control Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55" /> / <img alt="CMD Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55"
      /> + &quot;<span class="inline">F</span>&quot; to open up the Search box or <img alt="Control Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55" /> / <img alt="CMD Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png"
        width="55" /> + &quot;<span class="inline">H</span>&quot; to open up Search and Replace:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Script Editor Search Box" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Scripts_Search.png" />Here you can perform a <em>local </em>search for the keyword you input and once you have entered your search term, you can then use
      the arrows at the top right of the search window to skip from one found term to the next in the script. You can change how the search operation is carried out by toggling the following buttons:</p>
    <table class="icons" style="margin-left: 32auto">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td class="icons"><img alt="Exact Word Icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_ExactWord.png" style="margin-left: 24px;" /></td>
          <td class="text">When you toggle this, the search function will only highlight those strings that match the whole input string. For example, with it off a search for &quot;<em>random</em>&quot; will show up all words that contain this string - like <span class="inline">irandom()</span>,
            or <span class="inline">randomise()</span> - while toggling it to on would only show the function <span class="inline">random()</span>.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="icons"><img alt="Case Sensitive Icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_CaseSensitive.png" style="margin-left: 24px" /></td>
          <td class="text">When this option is toggled, you are telling GameMaker Studio 2 to check not only the contents of the search string, but the case too. For example, if you have a sprite called &quot;<span class="inline">spr_Dog</span>&quot; and do a search for
            &quot; <em>dog</em>&quot; with this toggle <em>off</em>, then the sprite string will be highlighted, however if the toggle is <em>on </em>then it won&#39;t since &quot;<em>Dog</em>&quot; is no longer considered the same as &quot;<em>dog</em>&quot;.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p class="dropspot">If you have opened the search window using <img alt="Control Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55" /> / <img alt="CMD Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55"
      /> + &quot;<span class="inline">F</span>&quot;, then the replace functionality will not be visible, so you need to click the Replace button <img alt="Replace Toggle Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_ReplaceToggle.png" /> to open
      it. Once open, you can then enter a string that will be used to replace any given search string, using the following buttons to perform the action:</p>
    <table class="icons" style="margin-left: 32auto">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td class="icons"><img alt="Replace Next Icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_ReplaceNext.png" style="margin-left: 24px" /></td>
          <td class="text">Clicking this will replace the next search string found in the script with the given replace string. Note that the &quot;next&quot; term is considered the next one after the current cursor position, and you can skip to different ones using arrow
            buttons at the top right of the search window.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="icons"><img alt="Replace All Icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_ReplaceAll.png" style="margin-left: 24px" /></td>
          <td class="text">Clicking this will replace <em>all </em>examples of the search string within the script using the given replace string.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p class="dropspot">Note that if you want to do a <em>global </em>search (ie: search the whole project rather than the current script or event), then you can press <img alt="Control Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55"
      /> / <img alt="CMD Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55" /> + <img alt="Shift Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Shift.png" width="55" /> + &quot;F&quot;.</p>
