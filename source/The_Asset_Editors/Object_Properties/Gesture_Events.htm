  <h1>The Gesture Events</h1>
  <p><img alt="The Gesture Events" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Objects_Gesture.png" /></p>
  <p>Events in the Gesture Event category will be triggered whenever GameMaker Studio 2 detects a &quot;gesture&quot; of the mouse or a touch screen event (while these gesture events are designed specifically for mobile use, they can also be used on other
    targets to detect the mouse, although they will not detect multiple touches in this case). The goal of the gesture system is to try and recognise inputs at a higher level than the direct mouse\touch reading functions, and is designed to simplify the
    implementation of commonly used inputs on touch-based devices.</p>
  <p class="note">NOTE: These events will not be triggered on the HTML5 platform due to lack of support for multi-touch using these events on that platform. If you are looking for gestures on that target then you should be using the <a href="../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Game_Input/Device_Input/Device_Input.htm">device functions</a>.</p>
  <p>You can choose to detect either <strong>instance </strong>gestures or <strong>global </strong>gestures, where instance gesture events will only be triggered when the initial touch/click is on an instance within the room. Note that the instance must
    have a valid collision mask (see <a href="../Sprites.htm">The Sprite Editor - Collision Mask</a> and <a href="../Objects.htm">The Object Editor - Collision Mask</a> sections for more details) for this event to be triggered. Global events, however,
    will be triggered by touching/clicking anywhere within the game room, and for all instances that have the event.</p>
  <p>When a gesture is recognised, it will trigger one or more of the available events, and the event triggered will depend on the type of gesture that has been detected. In every case, however, a <a href="../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Data_Structures/DS_Maps/DS_Maps.htm">DS Map</a> will
    be generated for you and stored in the built-in variable <span class="inline">event_data</span>. The keys available will depend on which kind of event it has been created by and are shown in each of the sub-sections below.</p>
  <p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong>: The variable <span class="inline">event_data</span> is only valid in these events, as the DS map that it points to is automatically created at the start of the event, then destroyed again at the end, with this variable being reset
    to a value of -1 at all other times.</p>
  <p>It is worth noting that if you have multiple instances under the position being touched and they all have a gesture event, then <em>all </em>of them will trigger, not just the &quot;topmost&quot; instance. Also note that when using multiple camera views
    and dragging an instance, the values returned will be based on the view you were in when the initial touch/click was received - this is true for all subsequent events in that gesture for that instance. So touching and dragging an instance in one view
    then releasing the touch in another view, will return values relative to the initial view where the gesture was first detected.</p>

    <p class="dropspot"><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down11" href="#">Tap</a></p>
    <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down11">
      <p class="dropspot">The Tap event will be triggered when an instance has been touched or clicked or - if it is a global event - when the game registers a touch or click anywhere in the room. A tap is considered a quick touch and release, and if the touch lasts too
        long then it will be considered a Drag (and trigger the Drag gesture events instead of the Tap event). This event will generate an <span class="inline">event_data</span> DS map which you can then use to get information about the event. For example:</p>
      <h4>Create Event</h4>
      <p class="code">x_goto = x;<br/> y_goto = y;</p>
      <h4>Tap Event</h4>
      <p class="code">x_goto = event_data[? &quot;posX&quot;];<br/> y_goto = event_data[? &quot;posY&quot;];</p>
      <h4>Step Event</h4>
      <p class="code">var _pd = point_distance(x, y, x_goto, y_goto);<br/> move_towards_point(x_goto, y_goto, clamp(_pd, 0, 5);</p>
      <p class="dropspot">The above code will detect a tap on the screen and then get the position of the tap to move the instance to that position. Note that if you want to have a longer or shorter tap detection time then you can set it with the function <a href="../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Game_Input/Gesture_Input/gesture_drag_time.htm"><span class="inline">gesture_drag_time()</span></a>.
        This sets the time between the initial detection and the tap becoming a drag, so set it to a higher value to make tap detection longer or a lower value to make it shorter (value is in seconds and defaults to 0.16).</p>

    <p class="dropspot"><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down6" href="#">Double Tap</a></p>
    <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down6">
      <p class="dropspot">The Double Tap event will be triggered when an instance has been touched or clicked twice in quick succession (or - if it is a global event - when the game registers two quick touches or clicks anywhere in the room). A double tap is considered two
        quick touches and releases, but if any of the touches lasts too long then it will be considered a Drag (and trigger the Drag gesture events instead of the Double Tap event). This event will generate an <span class="inline">event_data</span> DS
        map which you can then use to get information about the event. For example:</p>
      <h4>Create Event</h4>
      <p class="code">x_goto = x;<br/> y_goto = y;</p>
      <h4>Double Tap Event</h4>
      <p class="code">instance_destroy();</p>
      <p class="dropspot">The above code simply detects a double tap and then destroys the instance. Note that you can set the time between taps to trigger a double tap using the function <a href="../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Game_Input/Gesture_Input/gesture_double_tap_time.htm"><span class="inline">gesture_double_tap_time()</span></a> (which
        has a default value - in seconds - of 0.16) and you can also set the distance for detection between taps with the function <a href="../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Game_Input/Gesture_Input/gesture_double_tap_distance.htm"><span class="inline">gesture_double_tap_distance()</span></a> (if
        a second tap is detected outside of this distance it will be considered a regular tap event).</p>

    </div>
    <p class="dropspot"><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down7" href="#">Drag Start</a></p>
    <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down7">
      <p class="dropspot">The Drag Start event will be triggered when the user maintains a touch or click without releasing it. It will be triggered once when a set time has passed after the initial touch, which is 0.16 seconds by default (although you can set this to any
        other value in seconds using the function <a href="../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Game_Input/Gesture_Input/gesture_drag_time.htm"><span class="inline">gesture_drag_time()</span></a>). After this event has been triggered, and as long as
        the user has a touch/click held down, then the Dragging event will be triggered every step until the touch/click has been released. This event will generate an <span class="inline">event_data</span> DS map which you can then use to get information
        about the event. For example:</p>
      <h4>Create Event</h4>
      <p class="code">drag_offsetX = 0;<br/> drag_offsetY = 0;</p>
      <h4>Drag Start Event</h4>
      <p class="code">drag_offsetX = x - event_data[?&quot;posX&quot;];<br/> drag_offsetY = y - event_data[?&quot;posY&quot;];</p>
      <p class="dropspot">The above code uses the Drag Start event to get the position of the touch/click and use it to set an offset value for the x and y axis. This can then be used when dragging the instance to ensure that it doesn&#39;t &quot;jump&quot; to the position
        that the touch/click was detected at (see the Dragging event below for a continuation of this example).</p>
      <p class="dropspot"> </p>
    </div>
    <p class="dropspot"><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down8" href="#">Dragging</a></p>
    <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down8">
      <p class="dropspot">The Dragging event is triggered after the Drag Start event, and will be triggered for every step that the user maintains the touch/click on the instance (or the screen, if it&#39;s a global event) and moves more than the defined dragging threshold.
        This distance is 0.1 inches by default but can be set using the function <a href="../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Game_Input/Gesture_Input/gesture_drag_distance.htm"><span class="inline">gesture_drag_distance()</span></a>. If there is no
        movement or the movement is under the defined threshold, the event will not be triggered. This event will generate an <span class="inline">event_data</span> DS map which you can then use to get information about the event. For example:</p>
      <h4>Create Event</h4>
      <p class="code">drag_offsetX = 0;<br/> drag_offsetY = 0;</p>
      <h4>Drag Start Event</h4>
      <p class="code">drag_offsetX = x - event_data[?&quot;posX&quot;];<br/> drag_offsetY = y - event_data[?&quot;posY&quot;];</p>
      <h4>Dragging Event</h4>
      <p class="code">x = event_data[?&quot;posX&quot;] + drag_offsetX;<br/> y = event_data[?&quot;posY&quot;] + drag_offsetY;</p>
      <p class="dropspot">The example code above uses the offset variables set in the Drag Start event to move the instance when the Dragging event is triggered.</p>
      <p class="dropspot"> </p>
    </div>
    <p class="dropspot"><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down9" href="#">Drag End</a></p>
    <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down9">
      <p class="dropspot">The Drag End event is triggered when the user releases the touch/click on the instance (or the screen if the event is global). This event will generate an <span class="inline">event_data</span> DS map which you can then use to get information about
        the event, but in this event the map will have an extra key: &quot;<span class="inline">isflick</span>&quot;. Flick is calculated as the distance per second that the drag has occurred over, and the value for the &quot;<span class="inline">isflick</span>&quot;
        key will be true if it is greater than the defined distance per second value, or false otherwise. Note that the default is 2 inches per second, but you can set it to another value using the function <a href="../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Game_Input/Gesture_Input/gesture_flick_speed.htm"><span class="inline">gesture_flick_speed()</span></a>.
        Also note that there is a dedicated Flick event which will also be triggered if the &quot;isflick&quot; variable is true. An example of use would be:</p>
      <h4>Create Event</h4>
      <p class="code">flickVelX = 0.0;<br/> flickVelY = 0.0;</p>
      <h4>Drag End Event</h4>
      <p class="code">isFlick = event_data[?&quot;isflick&quot;];<br/> if (isFlick)<br/>     {<br/>     flickVelX = event_data[?&quot;diffX&quot;];<br/>     flickVelY = event_data[?&quot;diffY&quot;];<br/>     }<br/> else
        <br/>     {<br/>     flickVelX = 0;<br/>     flickVelY = 0;<br/>     }</p>
      <h4>Step Event</h4>
      <p class="code">x += flickVelX;<br/> y += flickVelY;<br/> flickVelX *= 0.7;<br/> flickVelY *= 0.7;</p>
      <p class="dropspot">The above code simply gets the difference in x and y position of the last Dragging event and the current Drag End event, and if the movement has been greater than the flick threshold, it sets some variables that are use to the move the instance
        in the step event.</p>
      <p class="dropspot"> </p>
    </div>
    <p class="dropspot"><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down10" href="#">Flick</a></p>
    <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down10">
      <p class="dropspot">The Flick event is only triggered when a touch/click has been held, dragged and then released and the distance between the last drag position and the release position is greater than 2 inches per second (this is the default setting, although this
        can be changed using the function <a href="../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Game_Input/Gesture_Input/gesture_flick_speed.htm"><span class="inline">gesture_flick_speed()</span></a>). This event will generate an <span class="inline">event_data</span>        DS map which you can then use to get information about the event. For example:</p>
