  <h1>The Sequence Canvas</h1>
  <p>When creating sequences for your projects a large part of the work will be done in the <strong>canvas</strong> of the <a href="../Sequences.htm">Sequence Editor</a>. The canvas is simply the area that will be used to contain the sequence elements, and
    it also defines what will be shown when the sequence is added to a room to be displayed. When you first create a sequence, the canvas will be set to the default size of 1366px by 768px, but this can be changed from the <strong>Toolbox </strong>by
    clicking the <img alt="Icon Grid Menu" class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_CanvasOptions.png"/> beside the <strong>Canvas Frame Toggle</strong> <img alt="Toggle Canvas Frame Icon" class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_ToggleCanvas.png"/> button:</p>
  <p><img alt="Sequence Editor Canvas Options" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Sequences_CanvasControls.png"/>The canvas size defines a visual area within which to place the assets that make up the sequence, but the frame is
    simply a guide to size and will not affect how things are rendered, ie: if you place a sprite asset outside the frame and add the sequence to a room, the asset will still be rendered.</p>
  <p>The frame is also used to house any <strong>reference images</strong> that you want to use to guide the positioning of assets within the sequence. A reference image can be added from the same <strong>Canvas Options</strong> menu where you set the size
    of the canvas frame, and will be used as a background image for the sequence canvas. This permits you to position things according to - for example - a UI mock-up from a project artist:</p>
  <p><img alt="The Canvas With A Reference Image" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Canvas_Reference.png"/>Note that reference images are not stored with the project and will not be rendered when the sequence is added to a room.</p>
  <p>Once you have the canvas set up how you want you can start to add assets to it. This is done simply by dragging them from the <a href="../../Introduction/The_Asset_Browser.htm">Asset Browser</a> into the canvas, which will create an <a class="tooltip" title="A track in the sequences track panel that holds a single asset, either a sprite, a sound, an instance, or a sequence.">asset track</a> in the <a href="The_Track_Panel.htm">Track Panel</a>:</p>
  <p><img alt="Adding An Asset To The Canvas" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Canvas_Add_Asset.gif"/>The assets that can be added to a sequence are as follows:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li>Sprites</li>
    <li>Objects</li>
    <li>Sounds</li>
    <li>Sequences</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once you have added the assets that are required, they can be placed at their initial positions for the animation, and can also be transformed using the various different <strong>Transform Control Gizmos</strong>. These are accessed in two different
    ways:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li>By moving the mouse to the edges of the asset in the canvas and clicking <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21"/> and dragging (note that the cursor will change to show the different transforms
      that will be changed):<br/>
      <img alt="Transforming The Asset In The Canvas" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Canvas_Edit_Transforms.gif" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 25px;"/></li>
    <li>By using the transform gizmo at the origin of the asset, which you can change from the canvas Toolbox:<br/>
      <img alt="Using The Transform Gizmo And The Toolbox" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Canvas_Edit_Widgets.gif" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;"/></li>
  </ul>
  <p>When you have set the initial transforms for the asset (if required) you can then use the canvas to add <a class="tooltip" title="A parameter key (also called a keyframe) is a point on the timeline in the dope sheet where a change in a parameter value is defined.">parameter key</a><span class="glossextra">s</span> to the asset track in the <strong>Track Panel</strong>.
    A simple example of how this works would be a basic position transform, where you would place the asset at it&#39;s start position, then move the <a class="tooltip" title="The current &#39;play&#39; position within the timeline in the Sequences dope sheet, the Animation Curve editor or the Sprite editor. In sequences (and sprites), this will move as the animation is previewed, and you can place it on specific frames to see and edit the keys and keyframes at that position.">playhead</a> in the <a href="Using_The_Dope_Sheet.htm">Dope Sheet</a>    to the frame you want the movement to end, and then move the asset again:</p>
  <p><img alt="Adding A Parameter Key To An Asset In The Canvas" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Canvas_Add_Keys.gif"/>As you can see in the image above, the new positions are automatically being recorded on the track as we have enabled
    &quot;<strong>Automatically Record Changes</strong>&quot; <img class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Seq_Record.png"/> in the Track Panel. You can also see that a dotted line has been added to the canvas view to indicate the movement through
    time of the asset. If you do not have the automatic recording enabled, you can still add points by moving the asset, then setting the playhead and then finally clicking the &quot;<strong>Record a new key</strong>&quot; <img class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Seq_Add.png"/> button.</p>
  <p>One final point worth mentioning is that the canvas permits you to use and add <strong>smart guides</strong>, which are guidelines that can be added to the canvas so that assets can be aligned against them. By default the canvas will show horizontal
    and vertical guides around the center point, as well as a rectangular guide around the &quot;edge&quot; of the sequence canvas, based on the size of the canvas. These guides will not be rendered in the final sequence when added to a room and are just
    there to help you get an idea of space and to help position things. You can also add your own guides by clicking <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21"/> on a ruler and then dragging into
    the canvas:</p>
  <p><img alt="Adding Guides To The Canvas" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Canvas_Adding_Guides.gif"/>To remove a guide, simply click on it and then drag it back towards the rulers again. When you have guides added to a sequence,
    moving an asset around will then &quot;snap&quot; to the guide when the bounding box or origin is near enough, and extra smart guides will be shown to mark the distances between assets as well as to mark assets that are all on the same guide or at
    the same position (these are coloured differently):</p>
  <p><img alt="Canvas Smart Guides" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Canvas_Smart_Guides.gif"/></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <h1>RMB Menu And Navigation</h1>
  <p>To navigate around the canvas view, you can use the same basic controls as the for a regular Workspace, ie: Use the middle mouse button <img alt="MMB Icon" class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_MMB.png"/> and drag to pan the canvas (or alternatively
    use the <img alt="Space Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Space.png" width="55"/> + <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/>), and you can scroll horizontally with the mouse
    wheel <img alt="MMB Icon" class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_MMB.png"/> or zoom in and out using the <img alt="CONTROL Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55"/> / <img alt="CMD Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55"/> key and the mouse wheel <img alt="MMB Icon" class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_MMB.png"/>.</p>
  <p>To select an asset, simply click the left mouse button <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/> on it, or you can select multiple assets using <img alt="CONTROL Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55"/> / <img alt="CMD Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55"/>  and <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/> to click on each asset. You can also select
    multiple assets using <img alt="Shift Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Shift.png" width="55"/> and then clicking <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/> and dragging. This
    will create a &quot;box&quot; in the canvas and any asset that touches the box area will be selected.</p>
  <p>When you have an asset or assets selected, you can cut, copy and paste them using the <img alt="CONTROL Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55"/> / <img alt="CMD Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55"/> +&quot;<span class="inline">X</span>&quot;,  <img alt="CONTROL Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55"/> / <img alt="CMD Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55"/> + &quot;<span class="inline">C</span>&quot; and  <img alt="CONTROL Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55"/> / <img alt="CMD Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55"/> + &quot;<span class="inline">V</span>&quot; key combinations.</p>
  <p>Note that when multiple assets are selected in the canvas, there will be a <a class="tooltip" title="For sprites, the bounding-box is the name given to the edges of the area that collisions will initially be detected in, and it doesn&#39;t have to be the same size as the sprite it&#39;s being applied to. For sequences, the bounding box is the outer edge of the total space that one or more assets occupy in the canvas.">bounding box</a> shown for each asset, and a larger bounding box shown for all of them combined. You can change how
    this bounding box behaves from the icons at the top left corner:</p>
  <p><img alt="Combined Selection BBox Controls" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Canvas_BBox_Controls.png"/>Clicking on the circle icon will change the transform control gizmo to the origin of the full bounding box for all assets selected,
    while clicking the box icon will show an individual control widget for each asset in the selection. You can move grouped assets around and copy/paste them etc... just as you would for a single asset.</p>
  <p>If you have multiple assets that are overlapping and wish to select a specific one without disturbing the rest, then you can hover the mouse over them to bring up the <strong>Item Toolbox</strong> which will show a list of icons for each item under
    the mouse. You can then click on one of these items to select it and edit it:</p>
  <p><img alt="The Item Toolbox" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Canvas_Item_Toolbox.gif"/>You also have a number of additional options available to you from the right mouse button <img alt="RMB Icon" class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png"/> when you click it on any asset in the sequence:</p>
  <p><img alt="Canvas Asset RIght Mouse Button Menu" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Canvas_RMB_Menu.png"/>The options available here are:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><strong>Record</strong>: this option permits you to record parameter keys for the asset(s), and if you hover over it you&#39;ll see options to record the <em>scale</em>, <em>rotation </em>or <em>position</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>Group</strong>: Selecting this will create a new group folder in the Track Panel, and move the selected asset(s) into it.</li>
    <li><strong>Rename</strong>: When you click this, the track will be highlighted in the Track Panel, and the name will be made editable, ready for you to change it.</li>
    <li><strong>Find In Sheet</strong>: When you click this, the selected asset will have its key highlighted in the Dope Sheet.</li>
    <li><strong>Find Other</strong>: When you click this, a list of all other assets of the same type will be shown for you to select one from.</li>
    <li><strong>Select</strong>: When you click this, a list of all assets that are overlapping at the clicked position will be shown, and you can select any of them for editing.</li>
    <li><strong>Remove Key</strong>: When you select this, the asset track key will be removed from the dope sheet at the current playhead position. The track itself will still exist, as will any parameter tracks it contains, and you can re-add another asset
      to the track by dragging it from the Asset Browser into the dope sheet.</li>
    <li><strong>Remove Track</strong>: This will remove the asset track (and parameter tracks if any are assigned to it) from the Track Panel, as well as all the keys related to it in the Dope Sheet.</li>
    <li><strong>Open Editor</strong>: This will open the asset for editing in the default editor for the type of asset.</li>
  </ul>
