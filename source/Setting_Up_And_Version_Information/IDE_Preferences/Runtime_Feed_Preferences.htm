  <h1>Runtime Feed Preferences</h1>
  <p><img alt="The Runtime Feeds Preferences" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Setup_And_Version/Preferences/Runtime_Prefs.png" />The <strong>Runtime Feeds Preferences</strong> are used to display and change the currently installed <a class="glossterm"
      data-glossterm="Runtime" href="#">Runtime</a> as well as the runtime in current use. GameMaker Studio 2 can have several different runtime tools installed at any one time and you can set which one to use from this preference. Ideally you want to be
    using the most up-to-date runtime, but sometimes it may have an issue, or you may be required to use an older one for comparability, etc... and so you can change the runtime tools that GameMaker Studio 2 uses to build your game here.</p>
  <p>The initial section of this preference is related to where you pull the runtime tools from and requires you to input a <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="URL" href="#">URL</a> to an <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="RSS" href="#">RSS</a> feed.
    This feed will then be scanned for updates to the runtime tools which can then be downloaded and installed. This section will show the Master runtime feed URL by default, but you can click the <em>Add </em>button to create a new Runtime Feed where
    you give the name and the URL for the RSS feed, and then click Apply to tell GameMaker Studio 2 to access it. You will need to close and re-open the Preferences window for the new feed to be shown.</p>
  <p>Once a Runtime Feed has been created it will be listed in this section as a sub-category, and you should always have at least one feed listed (by default this would be the <em>Master </em>feed). Regardless of the runtime being used, they will all have
    the same features, outlined below using the Master feed as an example:</p>
  <p><img alt="The Runtime Feed Master Preferences" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Setup_And_Version/Preferences/Runtime_Master_Prefs.png" />The Runtime Feed preferences are used to select, install and un-install the different runtime tools. At
    the top you have the current runtime tools being used, the date it was created, and the location that it is stored in on the hard drive. Beneath these details you can find a list of all the available runtimes, and you can choose any one from this
    list to change to being the &quot;running&quot; runtime used for compiling your projects.</p>
  <p>To select a different runtime to use, simply find it in the list and then double click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" /> on it. If the runtime has not been downloaded and installed, then you will be prompted
    to do so, and once it has been installed you will be asked to close and restart the IDE so that the new runtime can be initialised.</p>
  <p>This list details all the available runtimes, their version number, the date they were released, and - if they are installed - the path to where they have been installed to. The right hand side also shows the different status icons which are as follows:</p>
  <table class="icons">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td class="icons"><img alt="Status Running" height="16" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Running.png" width="48" /></td>
        <td class="text">This marks the current runtime that has been selected for use when building your projects.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="icons"><img alt="Status Download" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Download.png" /></td>
        <td class="text">Clicking this will initiate the download and installation of the selected runtime (a status bar will be shown in the top right of the <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="IDE" href="#">IDE</a>).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="icons"><img alt="Status Delete" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Delete_Runtime.png" /></td>
        <td class="text">Clicking this will remove the selected runtime from your hard drive.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>You can update the runtime list at any time from the given RSS feed clicking the refresh button  <img alt="Refresh Feed Icon" class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Refresh.png" /> , and you can clean your hard drive of old runtimes by clicking
    the &quot;Clean Runtimes Now&quot; button..</p>
