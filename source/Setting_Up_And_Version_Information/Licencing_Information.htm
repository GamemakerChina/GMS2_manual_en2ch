  <h1>Licencing Information</h1>
  <p>Once you have downloaded and installed GameMaker Studio 2, the first time you use it you will be requested to input your licence details:</p>
  <p><img alt="GameMaker Studio 2 Login Screen" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Setup_And_Version/Getting_Started_Login.png" />Your licence is tied to a <strong>YoYo Account</strong> (YYA) and you are required to have made one to be able to use GameMaker
    Studio 2 . This account holds all your licence details for the YoYo Games products that you own, and is also used for the <a href="../Introduction/The_Marketplace.htm">YoYo Games Marketplace</a>. You can find out further information about the YYA
    from the following page:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><a href="https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/216757288-Creating-a-YoYo-Account">Creating A YoYo Account</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="note"><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> After purchasing any new licence for GameMaker Studio 2 we recommend that you <strong>log out of the IDE and then restart GameMaker Studio 2</strong> <strong>and log back in again</strong> to make sure that the new licence
    is applied correctly. You can log out from the <a href="../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_File_Menu.htm">File Menu</a>.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <h1>Proxy Support</h1>
  <p>If you require Proxy Support for your installation of GameMaker Studio 2, this can be added simply by clicking the <strong>Proxy</strong>. This will bring up the following window:</p>
  <p><img alt="GameMaker Studio 2 Proxy Window" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Setup_And_Version/Getting_Started_Proxy.png" />You can now add in your proxy details. Some of the fields shown above are optional and if there is one you don&#39;t require
    then simply leave the field blank. Before continuing however it is worth noting that if you have set a proxy in your <a href="https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/4-ways-to-open-internet-options-in-windows-10.html">Windows Internet Options</a>, and
    it doesn&#39;t require a username/password, then it should just &quot;as is&quot; and you probably will not be required to set up the proxy in GameMaker Studio 2.</p>
  <p>If your proxy does require a username and/or password, then you&#39;ll need to add them in to the fields shown in the window above. Note that in these cases the username/password/proxy details will always be required, and that the proxy IP should also
    have the port added, ie: <span class="inline">xx.xx.xx.xx:port</span>.</p>
  <p>Once you have added the relevant information, click on Okay and log in to GameMaker Studio 2 as normal.</p>
