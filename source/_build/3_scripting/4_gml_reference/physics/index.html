<h2>Physics Functions</h2>

<div class="body-scroll">
<p><br>
</p>

<p>The integration of a dedicated physics library to <i>GameMaker
Studio 2</i> means that you can now take control over all aspects
of the physical behaviour of objects within your game world,
particularly collisions and object interaction. The "traditional"
collision system (which <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> defaults to) is a
"reactive" system, where you check for a collision and <i>then</i>
react to that collision with code that you place in individual
objects. This is fine for simple games, but when you have a large
number of objects and have to code how they all react to different
situations in the game world, it quickly becomes obvious that this
system is just not enough. That's when you have to turn to the
<i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> physics system.</p>

<p>The physics system works in a very different way to normal
collisions. It is more of a "passive" system where you define a
series of properties for your objects in the game world, as well as
the properties of the game world itself, before any collisions or
interactions occur. These coded "rules" will then govern the way
everything in your game world interacts. In this way, with a few
simple code and the correct room setup, you can create very complex
interactions between objects and the world which will occur and
resolve <i>without</i> you having to code for every single possible
outcome.</p>

<p>There are a few things that you should note when working with
the <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> physics world:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The physics system exists "apart" from the basic room and
instance structure of <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> meaning that its
timings and functions are not necessarily tied into the room speed
and step order like everything else.<br>
<br></li>

<li>The physics system replaces many of the normal instance
functions... for example, rather than set a speed and a direction
for an instance, if it has been declared as being a fully simulated
physical body, you would use a <i>force</i> or <i>impulse</i> to
get it to move around in the game world, or if it is not physics
enabled you will need to set the x an y positions yourself. This
takes a bit of getting used to, so experiment with the physics
functions and get to know how everything works before trying to
integrate them into your project.<br>
<br></li>

<li>You should limit the number of instances that are created, as
well as the number of collisions and collision groups that the
physics world has to deal with. You <i>cannot</i> have thousands of
instances, all with physical properties and collisions and expect
everything to work fine due to the fact that physics requires some
pretty intensive calculations, so limit yourself and optimise where
possible.<br>
<br></li>

<li>When setting up collisions, use parents as much as possible
since the collision system has a limited number of <i>collision
bits</i> available to assign to instances for Box2D to detect
collisions. For example, if you have five different wall objects,
don't check for five collisions, rather, create a parent object and
assign it to the five walls then have ONE collision check with the
parent. The physical properties of the objects are <i>not
inherited</i> only the collisions. In this way you can keep your
game optimised and error free.<br>
<br></li>

<li>Try not to move instances from one point of the room to another
in any way other than using the physics functions (ie: do not set
the x/y coordinates manual). Although this can be done and in some
circumstances it may be necessary, this is generally to be avoided
due to the unpredictable results that it may have on the physics
engine, especially when trying to resolve collisions.<br>
<br></li>

<li>Care should be taken when binding fixtures, as they can be
bound to objects and instances independently. This means that if
you bind a fixture to (for example) "o_Wall", <b>all</b> instances
of that object will get the fixture. If you only want to bind a
fixture to one instance, then use that instance's id in the
appropriate function.<br>
<br></li>

<li>Please be aware that due to differences in floating point
precision you may find that versions of your game for different
target platforms may exhibit subtly different behaviour to the
standard Windows version, though each version will be
self-consistent across subsequent executions.<br>
<br></li>

<li>To prevent instabilities in the physical simulation Box2D
constrains to upper limits the amount a body may rotate and
translate within a single update. The apparent limitations will
vary according to the accuracy of the physical simulation in
accordance with the number of updates and update speed of the
physics world, and also in accordance with the physics world
scaling. This means that (for example) if you have a world update
speed of 60, the maximum movement speed would be 20.<br></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, there are a couple of special physics functions which
may be useful for more advanced physics simulations. The first is
for testing for possible collisions at a specific point in the
room, and the second is for generating custom mass and inertia
properties within an instance:</p>
