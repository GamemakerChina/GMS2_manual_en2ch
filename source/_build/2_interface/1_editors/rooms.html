<h2>The Room Editor</h2>

<div class="body-scroll">
<p><br>
</p>

<p><img class="center" src="images/editor_room.png" alt=
"Room Editor">
</p>

<p>The room editor is where you create your game rooms. Every game
requires at least one room to run, and in the room you can place
<i>instances</i>, <i>sprites</i>, <i>tiles</i>, <i>paths</i> and
<i>backgrounds</i>. Each of these different assets can be placed on
their own unique layer which can then be ordered however you wish
in the <a href="#room_layers">Layers Editor</a>. Due to the
complexity of the room editor, we'll give you first a brief
overview of the most important features, and then you can find more
in-depth details from the section headers listed below.</p>

<p>When you create a room resource, you can right click <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_rmb.png"> on it in
the resource tree to open the room menu. This will permit you to
create child rooms (see <a href=
"#room_inhertitance">Inheritance</a> below), open up the room
properties for changing, add a new resource group to better
organise the rooms, rename the room or delete it. Note that you can
click and drag a room up or down in the resource tree to reposition
it, as well as drag a room onto another one to "attach" it to that
room visually (it will appear indented beneath the other room,
normally what you'd want to show parent/child inheritance), or drag
it onto a group folder to add it there.</p>

<p>Note that the room editor is itself a <a href=
"../../1_overview/2_quick_start/3_workspaces.html">workspace</a>
and as such you can click <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_lmb.png"> on the tab and drag it off of the main
window into a new window of its own - perhaps in another display,
for example. You can also place it back into the main window by
dragging the tab to the top of the IDE and releasing the mouse
button.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p><a name="room_interface" id="room_interface"></a>
</p>

<h2>Interface</h2>

<p>The user interface for the room editor is simple to navigate and
split in various discrete sections. Those parts of the editor that
are docked - the room properties and the layer editor as well as
the different layer property sections - can also be removed from
the dock by simply dragging them out into the workspace, and they
can be adeed back into the docks again by dragging them to the
sides or the bottom of the workspace.</p>

<blockquote><a name="room_editor_layer" id="room_editor_layer"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="eleven">Layer Editor</label>
<input id="eleven" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p><img class="center" src="images/editor_room_layers.png" alt=
"Room Editor Layer Editor">
</p>

<p>The room editor places things onto layers within the room. Each
layer is at a discrete "depth", where those that appear at the
bottom of the list in the layer window will be drawn under those
that appear near the top.</p>

<div class="note"><b>IMPORTANT!</b> There is a minimum and maximum
layer depth of -16000 to 16000. Anything placed on a layer outside
that range <b>will not be drawn</b> although all events will still
run as normal.</div>
<br>

<p>Layers are created by clicking <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png"> the
appropriate button for the type of layer you want to create, which
are:</p>

<ul>
<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_instance.png"> <b>Instance</b> - this type of layer
will hold all instances for your game</li>

<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_tilemap.png"> <b>Tile</b> - this type of layer is for
drawing sprites to as tile sets</li>

<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" src="images/icon_paths.png">
<b>Path</b> - this layer contains path data (you can only have one
path per layer)</li>

<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_assets.png"> <b>Asset</b> - this layer id for visual
assets to be placed on (ie: sprites)</li>

<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_background.png"> <b>Background</b> - This type of
layer defines a background, which is essentially a single colour or
image that is drawn</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also create a <b>layer folder</b> using the folder
button <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_folder.png"> where you can group selected layers
together, as well as delete the selected layers with the delete
button <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_delete.png">. Each of these layer types are discussed
<a href="#room_layers">here</a> in more detail.</p>

<p>Note that you can toggle inheritance for the layer editor which
will affect layer order and visibility. The visibility itself can
be set by clicking the eye icon <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="images/icon_eye.png"> beside each of the layers, or you can
click <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_lmb.png"> the one at the very top to
enable/disable all layers at once. You also have the possibility to
"lock" a layer (or all of them) so that they cannot be changed by
clicking the padlock icon <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_padlock.png">.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="room_layer_properties" id="room_layer_properties"></a>

<div class="index_list">
<p><img class="center" src="images/editor_room_layerproperties.png"
alt="Room Editor Layer Properties">
</p>

<p>The room layer properties window will change depending on the
currently selected layer in the layer editor. Each window will have
different properties and lists and you will be able to edit
fundamental details for how the layer is displayed and what is
actually on the layer. Please see <a href="#room_layers">here</a>
for more detail.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="room_properties" id="room_properties"></a> <label class=
"collapse" for="eight">Room Properties</label> <input id="eight"
type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>The room properties are split into the following three
sections:</p>

<blockquote><a name="room_settings" id="room_settings"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="seventeen">Room Settings</label>
<input id="seventeen" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list"><img class="center" src=
"images/editor_room_roomsettings.png" alt="Room Editor Settings">
<p>The room settings section is where you can set the inheritance
toggle for the settings, as well as name the room and whether it is
persistent or not. Normally, when you leave a room and return to
the same room later, that room is reset to its initial settings.
This is usually fine for most games but it may not be what you want
in, for example, an RPG or any non-linear game, where you want to
come and go between rooms and have them be way you left it the last
time. Checking the box labelled <b>Persistent</b> will do exactly
that. The room status will be remembered and when you return to it
later, it will be exactly the same as you left it, with it only
being reset to the start state when the game is reset. Note that
there is one exception to this - if you marked certain objects as
being persistent, instances of this object will not stay in the
room but move to the next room.</p>

<p>After that you have the option to <b>Clear Display Buffer</b>.
This option is similar to the previous one, only it fills the
back-buffer with a colour. If you know that the views are going to
be covering the whole screen at all times or that you have a
fullscreen background being drawn, then you can un-check this
(which saves a redraw and so helps optimise your game), but if you
have overlapping views that, when on the screen leave open spaces,
or your background has any transparency, you should check this so
that those area where there is no view are filled in with the draw
colour of your choice. Currently this colour can only be set
through code using <a href=
"../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/cameras%20and%20display/display/the%20game%20window/window_set_colour.html">
<tt>window_set_colour()</tt></a>.</p>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> If you are using automatic aspect
ratio correction (as set in the <a href=
"../../2_interface/3_settings/game_options/index.html">Game
Options</a>), then you should always have this checked otherwise
you can get odd effects over the "letterbox" that your game is
drawn in. If you do not use this option then you can un-check this
and get a small boost to your games performance (especially
noticeable on Android and other mobile platforms). Below this you
see the list of available views (you can define a maximum of eight)
with the information about where these views are to be drawn
contained in the boxes below. First of all you must indicate
whether the view should be Visible when the room starts by checking
the appropriate box, and if you wish to use views, make sure at
least one view is visible at the start of every room. Visible views
are shown in bold in the view list above this.</div>
<br>

<p>A room has to have a size and this is defined by the values that
you input for its width and height in pixels, and once that has
been set you can then go on to add <b>Creation Code</b>, should you
require it. Creation code is added from the button at the bottom
(along with the inherit toggle to say whether the room should
inherit it's creation code or not), and if you click it you will
open a <a href="scripts.html">code editor</a>. This editor allows
you to input functions and code that will be run at the start of
the room, <i>after</i> the create event of all instances but
<i>before</i> their room start event. This code will only be run
the first time you enter a room if the room is flagged as
persistent and subsequent visits will not run.</p>

<p>The final button in the Room Settings permits you to open the
<b>Instance Creation Order</b> window: <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_room_creationorder.png" alt="Room Tile Menu"> This
window lists all the instances in the room in the order that they
will be created (from top to bottom). Should you require a specific
instance to be created before any other, you can simply click
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png">
and drag it to the position your require.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="room_views" id="room_views"></a> <label class="collapse"

"checkbox">
<div class="index_list"><img class="center" src=
"images/editor_room_roomviews.png" alt="Room Editor Views">
<p>Camera views give a mechanism for drawing different parts of
your room at different places on the screen, or for drawing just a
part of your room to cover the whole screen. For example, in most
platform games, the camera view follows the main character, as, if
you could see the whole level on the screen, your character would
be too small to see and there would be no surprises for the player.
Camera views can also be used in multi-player co-op games, as they
permit you to create a split-screen setup in which in one part of
the screen you see one player and in another part you see the other
player. A further example is in games in which part of the room
should scroll (e.g. with the main character) while another part is
fixed (for example some status panel). This can all be easily
achieved in <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> using camera views.</p>

<p>At the top of the views properties you can toggle the view
inheritance on or off, then there is a box labelled <b>Enable
Viewports</b>. This must be flagged before any of the views can be
active in your game. The next checkbox is the one that says
<b>Clear Viewport Background</b>, which clears the application
surface with the window colour, and can be unchecked if you know
that you are drawing to cover the whole surface.</p>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> You can toggle inheritance on or off
for the three main view port settings, and then you toggle
inheritance on or off for each individual camera view.</div>
<br>

<p>A camera view is defined by two different sets of values, the
camera view itself and the <b>port</b> on the screen where this
view is to be drawn. This can sometimes cause confusion so let's
explain this a bit before explaining how we define each of
them:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>The Camera</b>: A point within the room that will be used to
set how the room is displayed on screen (this is an abstract piont
in the room editor and its position is set automatically based on
the view and view port settings)<br></li>

<li><b>The View</b>: What the camera sees, based on the position,
projection and rotation of the camera<br></li>

<li><b>The View Port</b>: The area of the physical screen where the
camera view will be displayed<br></li>
</ul>
<img class="center" src="images/camera_example.png" alt=
"Camera View">
<p>So, for example, this means that you can have a 640x480 camera
view into your room, and then set the port to 320x240, which will
display the view scaled down to that sized port on the screen, and
you can also do the same and set the view to a smaller value and
the port to larger making the image scale up to fit the port size
and be shown on the screen larger than it is. In this way you can
maintain a screen (port) size while changing the camera view to
display more or less of the room in the same area of the
screen.</p>

<p>The camera view is always defined as a rectangular area in the
room, where you specify the position of the top-left corner, the
width and the height of this area. Then you must specify where this
area is shown in the window on the screen by defining the view
port, where again you specify the position of the top-left corner
and the size (note that anything other than 0,0 for the top left
corner can give strange results). You can have more than one port
and they can overlap, in which case they are drawn in the indicated
order one on top of the other. Please realise that the overall
screen area is always defined as a rectangular area, so your ports,
even when offset, will form a rectangle, with any empty spaces
being filled in by the window colour, meaning that in these
circumstances you should always have Clear Display Buffer checked
or else you will get odd artefacts drawn in the spaces between
ports.</p>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> On Windows8 SurfaceRT devices, there
is a canvas limit of 2048x2048, which means the drawing canvas
cannot go above those dimensions (neither with views, nor by
setting the game window directly) otherwise your game graphics will
be corrupted or degraded.</div>
<br>

<p>The <b>Object Following</b> option is for when you want the view
to "follow" (ie: maintain the view focused on) a certain object. To
do this you must click <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_lmb.png"> on the menu icon and select an object
from the list that pops up (if there are multiple instances of this
object in the room, only one of them is followed by the view). The
normal behaviour for a view is to only move when the instance being
followed gets too close to a "buffer" zone that makes an invisible
boundary around the edge of the view. This zone can be defined by
you using the <b>Horizontal Border</b> and <b>Vertical Border</b>
values, so - for example - setting these values to 64 will mean
that the view will not start to move and follow the character until
he reaches 64 pixels from the edge of the view.</p>

<p>Finally you can indicate the speed at which the view moves when
the character has reached the buffer zone, and this has a default
value of -1. This default value is basically "instantaneous" and
means that the moment the follow object is outside the horizontal
border or vertical border buffer zone, the view will skip to its
current position. Now, this is not always what you want and so you
can set the vertical and horizontal scrolling speed for the view by
setting the values to something other than -1. Note that a value of
0 will cause the view to not move at all, and any other positive
value is how many pixels it will move in any step, so setting the
horizontal speed to 5 will have the view follow the object at 5
pixels per step horizontally.</p>

type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list"><img class="center" src=
"images/editor_room_roomphysics.png" alt="Room Editor Physics">
<p>Before you can use the built in physics functions you must tick
the option to <b>Enable Physics</b> at the top of this section (you
can also toggle the inheritance of this section independently of
the rest of the room settings). Once you have done that you can
then continue on to set up the physics world properties, which are
some basic properties that you must have pre-defined before your
room will allow physics instances to work as such. For a more
precise control over the world you can use code (see - <a href=
"../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/physics/index.html">The Physics
Functions</a> for more information).</p>

<p>The next thing you must do is set up the <b>Gravity</b> of the
world. The strength and direction of this is calculated as a vector
of the x/y position that you set around a (0, 0) point. So, an x of
0 and a y of 1 will set the gravity direction as being down with a
force of 1 metre per second (for a more detailed explanation see -
<a href=
"../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/physics/the%20physics%20world/physics_world_gravity.html">
The Physics World: Gravity</a>). Finally you must set the ratio of
<b>Pixels To Meters</b> for <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> to use as a
base for all its physics calculations. This is because the physics
functions work on real-world measurements, which is why we must set
this value, and you'll want to adjust this setting until the
average pixel size of the objects you are using translates roughly
into simulated physics objects of an appropriate size.</p>

controls to deal with how things are displayed. They are:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Toggle Canvas Grid</b> <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="images/icon_canvasgrid.png">: This will toggle on/off the Room
Editor canvas grid. This is a grid that <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i>
draws over the main canvas to divide it into sections, and by
default is set to 32x32px in size. However if you click the Grid
Menu icon <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_canvasoptions.png"> you will open the grid options:
<img class="center" src="images/editor_roomgridcontrols.png" alt=

grid colour and alpha, as well as the cell values for the grid
along the X and Y axis. You also have an option to enable or
disable grid snapping here (enabled by default). You can use the
keyboard shortcuts "<tt><b>G</b></tt>" and <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_shift.png"> +
"<tt><b>G</b></tt>" to toggle the grid visibility and grid snapping
respectively.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Canvas Zoom Controls</b> <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="images/icon_canvaszoom.png">: These buttons control the
current canvas zoom level. You can zoom in or out and clicking the
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_zoomequals.png"> button will reset the canvas to be
1:1 with the room being edited. You can also click the Window Fit
button <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=

within the current editor workspace (this will zoom in/out as
appropriate to make it fit). Note that you can also zoom in and out
using the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=

<li><b>Show Views</b> <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_canvasviews.png">: Clicking this will enable or
disable the view rectangle. When enabled you will see a highlighted
area that signifies the different views that are enabled for the
room.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Play Animations</b> <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_play.png">: When adding sprites, assets or animated
tiles, you may want to get an idea of how these will look within
the room itself without having to compile, and so you can click
this to start all the different animations playing. Clicking it
again will stop the animation.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Canvas Select From Any Layer</b> <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="images/icon_canvasselect.png">: By
default when you click on an element in the room canvas you will
only be able to select those assets that are on the layer currently
being edited, however if you enable this option you can then click
on <i>any</i> element and it will be selected, changing the target
layer to the one that the element is on. You can use the keyboard
shortcut "<b><tt>P</tt></b>" to temporarily enable this (hold

<h2>Inheritance</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most important feature of the room editor is
<b>inheritance</b>. Inheritance means that you can create a
"parent" room then from that create a "child" room which will
inherit all the parent room's properties. This child room is
essentially a clone of the parent, and everything in it is linked
to the parent room. This means that if you change the view in the
parent, or move a tile, or add instances, it will be reflected in
the child room. Not only that, in the child room you can
selectively switch off inheritance for specific layers, instances,
assets or anything else that is required. A room that has inherited
properties will have the <b>inherit</b> buttons lit, as shown by
the image below, and you can then uses them to toggle inheritance
on or off for the given layer or resource, etc... <img class=
"center" src="images/editor_room_inheritance.png" alt=
"Room Inherit Buttons"></p>

<p>This can be tough to visualise at first, so let's look at an
example: say you have a room with a city and a castle in the
middle. The city and castle are drawn using different tile layers
and you also have instances and some paths for NPCs to use to walk
around. You want to have it so that in the game the castle is
destroyed, but everything else in the city looks and behaves the
same. You would create the initial room with everything as normal,
then you'd create a child room which inherits the parent room
layers. In the child room you'd switch off inheritance for the tile
layer (or even individual tiles) for the castle area and them
move/add/delete tiles to create the destroyed castle look. When a
player enters that room, all the instances from the parent room and
all the tiles etc... will remain exactly the same, except for those
of the destroyed castle.</p>

<div class="note"><b>IMPORTANT!</b> If you edit any inherited
property it will automatically turn <b>off</b> inheritance in the
section it belongs to without having to first click the inherit
button.</div>

<p><br>
To create room inheritance, you simply select the room you want to
create a child from and then right-click <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_rmb.png">. This will
open the room menu and there you can select <b>Create Child</b> to
create a new child room. This will be created and "attached" to the
parent visually in the resource tree: <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_roominheritance.png" alt="Room Inheritance"></p>

<p>You can also drag any room from the resource tree onto any other
room in the resource tree to have it become a child of that room
(or drag a child room off a parent and break the inheritance). Note
that inheritance is multi-layered and you can check individual
items, groups of items on a single layer, item properties, or whole
rooms as inheriting, and you can also inherit from consecutive
rooms (so room C inherits from room B, which in turn has inherited
from Room A). If you create a base room with nothing in it except
the view setup - for example - you can then create all further
rooms as being its children. But you can go a step further and
create another base room with the "view" room as its parent which
holds the general GUI instance and the controllers required in
every game room. Now you can create child rooms from <i>this</i>
and they will inherit <i>both</i> the controllers and GUIs from the
parent room as well as the view setup from the parent of that
room!</p>

<p>As you can hopefully see, inheritance is <i>very</i> powerful
and you can use it to maintain a much cleaner room structure, speed
up the workflow and generally optimise the time you spend making
and designing rooms.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p><a name="room_layers" id="room_layers"></a>
</p>

<h2>Layers</h2>

<p>To start with, everything that goes into the room you create is
placed on a <b>layer</b>. Layers can be added, removed, and sorted
from the <a href="#room_layers">Layers Editor</a>, and come in a
variety of different types, each with their own set of options and
way of working. You aren't limited to the number of each type of
layer, and can have multiple tile layers, or path layers, or
instance layers, etc... Each type of layer has it's own
<b>properties window</b> where you can set different things
depending on the layer type. You can also toggle the layers
visibility, with invisible layers not being processed at runtime
(but you can make them visible again at any time using the
appropriate layer function). <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_room_layers.png" alt="Room Layers"></p>

<p>The image above shows the layer editor, with the current layers
being listed at the top, and the different buttons for creating
layers at the bottom. You can rename any layer from this editor by
doing a slow double click on the name (note that you cannot use
anything except letters numbers and the underbar "_" character for
names) and you can also switch its visibility on or off by clicking
the eye icon <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_eye.png">. If the room has inherited layers from a
parent room, you can toggle the inheritance from the button at the
bottom, but note that this will affect <i>all</i> layers. You can
also use <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_shift.png"> or <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_ctrl.png">/<img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="../../images/icon_cmd.png"> and left click <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png"> on
multiple layers to select them for duplication or deletion (these
options are available from the right mouse <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_rmb.png"> Menu).</p>

<p>To help with ordering your layers and keeping them tidy, you can
create groups of layers in a <b>layer folder</b> by clicking the
folder icon <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_folder.png">. You can also delete one or more selected
layers by clicking the delete button <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="images/icon_delete.png">. All layers
will also have a <b>depth</b> value, which defines where in the
draw order that layer will be placed when rendering its contents to
the room. Layers are drawn from the highest depth to the lowest, so
a layer at a depth of -100 will be drawn over a layer with a depth
of 200.</p>

<div class="note"><b>IMPORTANT!</b> There is a minimum and maximum
layer depth of -16000 to 16000. Anything placed on a layer outside
that range <b>will not be drawn</b> although all events will still
run as normal.</div>
<br>

<p>If you right-click <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_rmb.png"> on any layer you get the layer menu:
<img class="center" src="images/editor_room_layersubmenu.png" alt=
"Room Layer Menu"></p>

<p>Here you can open the layer properties window for the selected
layer, delete the layer, rename the layer, or add a <b>sub
layer</b>. If you choose to add a sub layer, then the current layer
will receive a "folder" icon to show that there are sub-layers
attached, and the new layer will be created below it, tabbed to the
right. You can then choose to have the sub-layer inherit its
properties from the parent layer, and also set whether it should
inherit the visibility from the parent layer.</p>

<p>Note that you can drag layers up or down in the window to
re-order them, and you can select and move multiple layers too
using either <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_shift.png"> + <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="../../images/icon_lmb.png"> to select from one layer to
another (including all those in between) or <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_ctrl.png">/<img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="../../images/icon_cmd.png"> + <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png"> to select
layers one at a time. If you place the layers on top of a layer
folder, they will be moved and set as sub-layers of the folder you
dropped them on to. You can also lock layers so that they cannot be
edited by mistake.</p>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: In the actual editor window where
you place the different assets on their layers, you can hold down
"<b><tt>P</tt></b>" +<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_lmb.png"> anywhere to instantly select the asset
and skip to the layer that it has been placed on.</div>

<p>You can add a new background layer by clicking on the

and then open up the background properties window: <img class=
"center" src="images/editor_room_backgroundproperties.png" alt=

background layer it is empty by default and so draws the defined
background colour. If you do not assign a sprite for the background

the colour box to open the colour picker and change the colour
used. If you do choose a sprite, then you can tick the tiling
options to tile it horizontally or vertically, or to make it
stretch the image to fill the whole room.</p>

<p>If you want to have the background scroll in a direction, you
can set the horizontal and/or vertical speed too (each game step it
will move along the given access by the number of pixels that you
set here), and you can also re-position the background image by
setting the x and y offset values. You can also set the animation
speed for the background if the sprite resource that you have
selected has multiple sub-images, although this is locked by
default to the value that you set in the Sprite Editor for the
image used. Finally you can set the depth for the layer explicitly,
although again by default this is locked and you can simply drag
and reorder the layer order in the Layer Editor to change this
value.</p>

<p>Note that you can toggle the inheritance for a background from
this window too by clicking the button at the very top.</p>

<div class="index_list">
<p>You can add a new instance layer by clicking on the <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="images/icon_instance.png"> button.
This will add the new layer, and then open up the instance
properties window: <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_room_instances.png" alt=
"Room Layer Instance properties"></p>

<p>This window simply shows a list of all the instances that are
currently on the layer. You can add more instances to a layer by
opening up the resource tree and then dragging objects from there
into the room, or alternatively you can select an instance from the
resource tree and then press and hold <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_alt.png"> to preview
the resource "in-situ", and if you additionally click the left
mouse button <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_lmb.png"> you can add the instance and even
"paint" it into the room layer.</p>

<p>The layer list can be ordered by clicking <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png"> and
dragging an instance in the list to the position required, but it
is worth noting that this is purely for organisational purposes
within the room editor and if you want to set a specific creation
order, please use the <b>Creation Order Window</b>, which can be
opened from the <b>Room Settings</b> window, or from the
<b>Room</b> context menu (see further down this page for more
information).</p>

<p>Double-clicking <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_lmb.png"> on any instance - either in the room
editor itself or in the properties list - will open a new window to
let you modify aspects of that single unique instance: <img class=
"center" src="images/editor_room_instanceproperties.png" alt=
"Room Instance properties"></p>

<p>By default the instance will have a name like "inst_38B0BFF",
but this can be changed to anything you want as long as the name
uses only alpha-numeric characters and the under-bar "_" (and no
spaces). However it's worth noting that the name given here
(whether one you give, or the default one that the IDE gives) is
considered a <tt>constant</tt> and so <b>must be unique to the
instance</b>. This also means that it can be used in code n your
game to identify the instance, but only if you are in the same room
as the instance.</p>

<p><a name="room_instance_variables" id=
"room_instance_variables"></a> Below the instance name you can set
whether the instance it is to inherit from the parent room, change
the object that you want it to be an instance of or even open up
the <a href="objects.html">Object Editor</a> to change the
properties there. You can also open up in a new window the object
editor for the instance should you wish to change anything there,
and also check and edit variables through the <b>Object
Variable</b> window (for more information on Object Variables,
please see the section <a href="objects.html">here</a>). You can
change the characteristics of this instance too, setting a colour
to blend it with (white by default), or rotating and flipping it,
as well as scale the instance along either or both the axis, and
set its position within the room.</p>

<p>Finally you can give the instance some <b>creation code</b>
which will run directly after the object creation event code, and
is unique to this instance (so you can, say, set a variable in the
object which all instance will have then modify it in the creation
code so that it's a unique value for one instance). Clicking this
will chain a <a href="scripts.html">code window</a> to the instance
where you can add any functions or modify any variables. Note that
you can toggle inheritance of creation code on or off independently
of the instance inheritance.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that each instance on a layer is
automatically flagged for exporting when the game is made. However,
especially when working with inheritance, it may be that you don't
want specific instances to be added to the room in the final game
(or you may have a debug instance in every room and simply want to
exclude it from the final game). If that is the case, then simply
un-checking the "Export" checkbox to the left of the instance in
the list will prevent it from being exported as part of the
executable. <b>It is important to note, however, that if you have
<i>any</i> code that references that object, then the game will not
run correctly, so use this feature with care</b>.</p>

<div class="index_list">
<p>You can add a new asset layer by clicking on the <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="images/icon_assets.png"> button. This
will add the new layer, and then open up the asset properties
window: <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_room_layerassetproperties.png" alt=
"Room Layer Asset properties"></p>

<p>An asset layer is simply a sprite that has placed into the room,
and you can place them by either dragging them in from the resource
tree or by selecting the one you want in the resource tree and then
using <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_alt.png"> + <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="../../images/icon_lmb.png"> to "paint" them. Sprite assets are
similar to tiles, only they can be fully animated - if the sprite
used has sub-images they will be shown - without the restrictions
that are in place for tiles, ie: they aren't forced to a grid and
animations can be any length and speed. While placing sprites on
the asset layer they will snap to the grid snap values set at the
top of the room editor for the grid, but if you want to place them
freehand, simply switch off the grid.</p>

<p>Once you place an asset in the room, you have a certain amount
of control over how it looks by double clicking <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png"> on it to
open the asset properties window: <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_room_assetproperties.png" alt=
"Room Asset properties"></p>

<p>From here you can give the asset a unique name, set whether it
is to inherit from the parent room, or change the sprite that you
want it to display. You can change the characteristics of this
sprite asset too, setting a colour to blend it with (white by
default), or rotating and flipping it. You can also scale the
instance along either or both the axis, and set it's position
within the room. If the sprite has sub-images, you can choose the
animation speed as well as set the initial frame to be shown,
although this is locked by default to the animation speed set for
the image in the Sprite Editor.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that each sprite on a layer is automatically
flagged for exporting when the game is made. However, especially
when working with inheritance, it may be that you don't want
specific sprites to be added to the room in the final game. If that
is the case, then simply un-checking the "Export" checkbox to the
left of the sprite in the list will prevent it from being exported
as part of the executable. It is important to note, however, that
if you have <i>any</i> code that references that sprite asset, then
the game will not run correctly, so use this feature with care.</p>

<h2>Context Menu</h2>

<p>Apart from the in-editor tools, you will also see a new drop
down menu has been added to the top of the IDE. <img class="center"
src="images/editor_roomcontextmenu.png" alt="Room Editor Menus">
These menus are explained below:</p>

<blockquote><a name="room_menuview" id="room_menuview"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="twelve">Layer View</label> <input id=
"twelve" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>This will re-open the Layer Editor window should you have closed
it at any time.</p>

<label class="collapse" for="Seventeen">Instance Creation
Order</label> <input id="Seventeen" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>This will open the Instance Creation Order Window (which can
also be opened by using the button in the <b>Room Settings</b>
window): <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_room_creationorder.png" alt="Room Tile Menu"> This
window lists all the instances in the room in the order that they
will be created (from top to bottom). Should you require a specific
instance to be created before any other, you can simply click
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png">
and drag it to the position your require.</p>

<a name="room_menulayout" id="room_menulayout"></a> <label class=
"collapse" for="fifteen">Reset Windows On Current Desktop</label>
<input id="fifteen" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>This will reset the room editor window layout to its default
values for the desktop workspace currently focused.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="room_menutiles" id="room_menutiles"></a> <label class=
"collapse" for="sixteen">Tile Editing</label> <input id="sixteen"
type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>When working with a tile layer, this option will be highlighted
in the drop down menu. It has the following sub-menu: <img class=
"center" src="images/editor_room_tilemenu.png" alt=
"Room Tile Menu"></p>

<p>When editing the tile layer you can select multiple tiles by
clicking, holding down and dragging the left mouse button
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_lmb.png">, or you can select and group
individual tiles using <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_ctrl.png">/<img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="../../images/icon_cmd.png"> + <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png">, or remove
individual tiles from the selection using <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_alt.png"> +
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_lmb.png">. From this menu you can then clear the
selection or invert it as well as cut, copy or paste the selection
to another layer (or even the same layer but in another position).
The final option will re-open the <a href="tilesets.html">tile set
editor</a> window should you have closed it.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="room_menuconvert" id="room_menuconvert"></a> <label class=
"collapse" for="fish">Convert Image To Tilemap</label> <input id=
"fish" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>The <b>Convert Image To Tilemap</b> option is a powerful tool
that can be used to import a single image and then extract the
tiles used from the image and recreate it as a tilemap layer in the
room editor, creating the required tileset and sprite as part of
process. When you select this tool, you will be asked to supply an
uncompressed image file (<tt>PNG</tt>, <tt>GIF</tt> or
<tt>BMP</tt>) which will then be loaded. On load you will be
presented with the <b>Image Import</b> tool: <img class="center"
src="images/editor_room_convertimage.png" alt=
"Convert Image To Tilemap"></p>

<p>Here you are given options on how to split up the tile when
creating the tileset, and you can set the cell width and height as
well as any offsets required around the edges. You can also set the
approximate width (in pixels) for the final sprite that is created.
For example, if the tileset is made up of 64x64 tile cells and you
set a width here of 200, the final sprite that is created for use
in the tileset will be 192 pixels wide (ie: 3 tile cells). If you
leave it at the default value of 0, then <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i>
will attempt to make as "square" a sprite as possible with
approximately the same number of horizontal and vertical tile
cells.</p>

<p>After setting the way the image is to be split, clicking the
swatch beside the <b>Remove Colour</b> option will open the colour
picker and permit you to select a colour that is to be removed from
the final sprite. This is usually a background colour that you want
to remove and setting this swatch to anything other than 100%
transparent will (alpha 0) will remove the selected colour on
import.</p>

<p>Finally, you have the option to name the sprite, tileset and
tilemap layer that will be created for you by this tool. When you
finalise the import, a sprite with all the images laid out in a
grid will be created, as well as a tileset from this sprite. In the
room, a new tilemap layer will be created and the image reproduced
using the generated tileset. Note that the tool will <i>not</i>
duplicate tiles and will instead recognise when a cell has image
data that coincides with another cell (this includes rotated
tiles). You can see this in the following image where only one
flower tile has been created and one crate tile too, yet there are
multiple instances of both, with some instances rotated in the base
