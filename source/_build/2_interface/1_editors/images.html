<h2>The Image Editor</h2>

<div class="body-scroll">
<p><br>
</p>

<p><img class="center" src="images/editor_images.png" alt=
"Image Editor">
</p>

<p>The image editor is where you can create your own sprites or
edit those you have imported or created previously. If you have
used any image tools previously then this should be familiar to you
but there are a few things to note when using the <i>GameMaker
Studio 2</i> image editor which may not be immediately
apparent:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>When you create multiple frames, you can draw to them as they
animate! So, if you press the play button on the <b>Frame
Control</b> bar, and then select a brush and start to draw in the
editor window, you'll see that the frames will animate in the
editor and what you draw will be added to the corresponding frame
in that moment. You can experiment with different frame rates until
you get something you like, but once you've got the hang of how
this works you'll be creating dynamic sprites and effects in no
time.<br>
<br></li>

<li>You can pull the Image Editor tab off of the main workspace
window into it's own window. This can be handy when using multiple
monitors, for example.<br>
<br></li>

<li>When you use the copy functions to, for example, copy a
selection of an image, then the selection copied gets added to your
brush list. This means that you can select a part of an image and
then use it in the rest of the paint tools to draw lines, polygons
or just paint freely. The brush can be scaled and blended with a
colour too. Note that the <i>Paste</i> functionality is not
intended for use internally within the editor as anything you copy
is added to the brush list and so can be selected for "pasting"
that way. Instead paste is simply for you to capture something from
an external program and paste it into the Image Editor.<br>
<br></li>

<li>You can have multiple layers for each sprite thanks to the
handy layer editor. These layers can ordered and even placed in
folders to make creating more complex images easier.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Those are just some of the more advanced features that the image
editor offers. To find out the full feature range, please read the
items below detailing the functions of every part of the
editor:</p>

<blockquote><a name="image_view" id="image_view"></a> <label class=
"collapse" for="one">Frame View</label> <input id="one" type=
"checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>This part of the window shows the frames in the order that they
will be animated in. You can click the (+) button to the left to
add further frames - or use the <a href="#image_menu">Image
Menu</a> - and you can also click and drag any of the frames to
change its position along the time-line. In the top left of the
Frame View you can switch on Onion Skinning <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="images/icon_onionskin.png">, which
means that in a single frame of any sprite animation, you can
choose to see any of the preceding or succeeding frames as a
semi-transparent layer under the image frame you are currently
editing. The great thing about this is that each frame is drawn
slightly lighter than the last so you can see how the animation has
been progressing from frame to frame while drawing the next one.
Enabling this will show some extra controls over the frames which
you can click and drag to set the number of preceding frames to
show as well as the number of following frames. <img class="center"
src="images/editor_onionskin.png" alt=
"Image Editor Onion Skin"></p>

<p>Beneath the Onion Skin button, you have the Loop Control button
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="images/icon_imageloop.png">
used to set whether the sprite loops (goes back to frame 1 when the
last frame is reached) or ping-pongs (goes backwards through the
frames when the last frame is reached). The Play button <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="images/icon_imageplay.png"> at the
bottom is for starting/stopping the preview of the animation.</p>

<p>You can click on any frame to select it for editing, and a
selected frame will have a Delete icon <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="images/icon_removeframe.png"> at the
top corner which you can click to remove the frame from the sprite.
You can also click <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_ctrl.png">/<img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="../../images/icon_cmd.png"> + <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png"> on
multiple frames to select them together, in which case clicking the
Delete icon will delete <i>all</i> the selected frames.</p>

<a name="image_controls" id="image_controls"></a> <label class=
"collapse" for="two">Frame Information</label> <input id="two"
type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>This bar contains the Frame Controls. Here you can set the speed
at which the animation frames should be played back using the input
box on the left. The frame speed can either be based on "Frames per
second", or "Frames per game frame". The total number of frames
available are shown to the right along with the current frame that
has been selected, and you can collapse this bar (hide it) by
clicking on the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_collapse.png"> icon to the left. Note that the value
used here for the animation speed <i>will also set the way the
sprite is animated when used in a game</i>, either as a sprite
asset on a layer or as a sprite assigned to an instance, although
you can modify this at runtime using the appropriate <a href=
"../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/rooms/sprites/layer_sprite_speed.html">
functions</a> and <a href=

<a name="image_canvas_control" id="image_canvas_control"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="thirteen">Canvas Controls</label>
<input id="thirteen" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>The canvas controls deal with various aspects of how the main
draw canvas and its contents are displayed. The options are:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Toggle Canvas Grid</b> <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="images/icon_canvasgrid.png">: This will toggle on/off the
canvas grid. This is a grid that <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> draws
over the main canvas to divide it into sections, and by default is
set to 1px in size. However if you click the Grid Menu icon
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_canvasoptions.png"> you will open the grid options:
<img class="center" src="images/editor_images_gridoptions.png" alt=
"Image Editor Grid Options"> These options permit you to set the
grid colour and alpha, as well as the cell values for the grid
along the X and Y axis. You also have an option to enable or
disable grid snapping here (disabled by default).<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Canvas Zoom Controls</b> <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="images/icon_canvaszoom.png">: These buttons control the
current canvas zoom level. You can zoom in or out and clicking the
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_zoomequals.png"> button will reset the canvas to be
1:1 with the image being edited. Note that you can also zoom in and
out using the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_ctrl.png">/<img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="../../images/icon_cmd.png"> and the Mouse Wheel <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_mmb.png">, and
pressing <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_ctrl.png"> + <b><tt>Enter</tt></b> will set the
canvas to be 1:1 with the image. You can also click the Window Fit
button <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_canvasfit.png"> to make the entire room canvas fit
within the current editor workspace (this will zoom in/out as
appropriate to make it fit).<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Split Canvas</b> <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_canvassplit.png">: Clicking this will cycle between
splitting the canvas horizontally, vertically keeping it a single a
single canvas. When in split canvas view, each canvas will have its
own set of Canvas controls so you can zoom one in and the other
out, for example, and you can edit either canvas with the changes
being reflected in the other canvas. To change the canvas view
toggle, you can click the Split Options <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="images/icon_canvasoptions.png"> button
and select the one you wish to use or simply click the SPlit View
button until it cycles to the one you want.</li>

brush will be white, but if you change the colour with the <a href=

will be blended with this new colour. If you want to remove a brush
from the list, simply click on it and press the <img style=

below as swatches beside the image of the mouse, and you can then
click these to open the <b>Colour Picker</b> window: <img class=

"Image Editor Colour Picker"></p>

<p>From this window you can define the colour using any of the
available sliders and gadgets, or you can input values directly for
the RGBA values or HVS values. Note that if you double click
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png">
on any of the default colour swatches, you can also bring up the
colour picker tool and edit the default palette for the sprite.
Clicking "Okay" in the colour picker in this case will set the
palette to the new colour and save it along with the sprite
resources. These colour palettes can then be swapped and applied to
different sprites using the colour palette Options menu:
<img class="center" src="images/editor_colourpicker_options.png"
alt="Image Editor Colour Picker Options"></p>

<p>So, you can create a custom colour palette in a sprite image and
then use that to set the palette for any other sprite in the
resource tree, or you can open a sprite image and import the colour
palette from any other sprite in the resource tree.</p>

<div class="index_list">
<p>You can create <b>layers</b> in the image editor for different
parts of your image, and these layers can be manipulated and drawn
to using the various brushes and tools. To create a new layer,
simply click the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_add.png"> icon, and to remove it again the <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="images/icon_remove.png"> icon. Layers
can also be ordered by clicking <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="../../images/icon_lmb.png"> on a layer and then dragging the
layer up or down to the position you require, and you can further
organise the layers by creating folders using the <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="images/icon_folder.png"> button and
then dragging layers into them. If you double click <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png"> on a layer
(or use <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_rmb.png"> and select <i>Edit Layer
Properties</i>) you'll get access to the <b>Layer Properties</b>
window: <img class="center" src="images/editor_layerproperties.png"
alt="Image Editor Layer Properties"></p>

<p>Here you can name the layer as well as set the blend mode (the
way that it should be "mixed" with the layers beneath), choosing
from <b>normal</b>, <b>additive</b>, <b>subtractive</b> or
<b>multiply</b> blends. Finally you can set the opacity
(transparency) of the layer with a slider, but note that this is
<i>cumulative</i> with the actual alpha value of individual pixels
- for example, if you have pixels that are 50% opaque and set the
layer opacity to 50%, the final pixels will be drawn at 25%
opacity.</p>

<h2>Context Menu</h2>

<p>Apart from those tools within the image editor itself, there are
also a number of extra tools available to you from the Menu Bar at
the top of the IDE: <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_menus.png" alt="Image Editor Menus"></p>

<p>These menus are explained below:</p>

<blockquote><a name="image_menu" id="image_menu"></a> <label class=
"collapse" for="nine">Image</label> <input id="nine" type=
"checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p><img class="center" src="images/editor_menuimages.png" alt=
"Image Editor Image Menu"> The Image menu has the following
options:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Cut Frame / Selection</b> - Cut the frame or selection from
the image (depending on Editor focus). If cutting a selection, this
will add it to the <a href="#image_brushes">brushes</a>.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Copy Frame / Selection</b> - Copy the frame or the selection
from the image (depending on Editor focus). If copying a selection,
this will add it to the <a href="#image_brushes">brushes</a>.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Paste Frame / Selection</b> - Paste the frame from the
clipboard, or paste the selection from the clipboard to the image
(depending on the current focus of the IDE). When pasting into an
image, you should note that this option is designed <i>only for use
with clipboard data from external programs</i>. When you cut or
copy to the clipboard from an image in the Image Editor, this is
added to the brushes in the top right of the editor, and you should
select a brush to draw with the cut/copied selection rather than
try to paste it into the image. Also note that a number of programs
will have issues pasting transparencies from the clipboard into
<i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> image editor due to the format used by
the clipboard.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Select All</b> - Select the full image.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Cancel Selection</b> - Clear any selection from the
image.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Invert Selection</b> - Invert the current selection.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Add Frame</b> - Add a new frame to the sprite.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Insert Frame</b> - Insert a new frame after the one
currently showing.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Delete Selected Fames</b> - Remove the selected frame from
the sprite (you can use <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_shift.png"> + <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="../../images/icon_lmb.png"> and/or <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_shift.png"> +
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png">
to select multiple frames).<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Import Image(s)</b> - Load an image to be used as a frame
from disk. Note that you can load multiple frames at once by
selecting multiple individual files to import in the explorer
window. Once you have selected your file or files you will be shown
the following Import window: <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_image_import.png" alt="Image Editor Import Window">
Here you can choose how the imported image should be added to the
current sprite, permitting you to resize the entire draw canvas,
crop or pad it, and also set the "anchor" position for placing the
new image(s).<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Convert to Frames</b> - This option will convert a single
image into a number of separate frames. You must first have created
a single frame with all the parts of the animation in it (or
imported a single strip image) like the one shown below:
<img class="center" src="images/editor_image_strip.png" alt=
"Image Editor Animation Strip"> Since this is a single image and we
want to convert it into individual frames, we can use this option
which will then open the following window: <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_image_convertstrip.png" alt=
"Image Editor Convert to Animation Frames"> Here you can set how
the single image should be split to create the frames, setting the
number of frames, the width and height of the frames and any
including any offset values.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Import Strip Image</b> - This option will open a file
explorer and prompt you to look for a single strip image file to be
used to create frames from. Once selected an image the Import strip
window will open, exactly the same as for the Convert To Frames
option shown above.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Export to PNG</b> - Selecting this option will export the
sprite as a single PNG image. If the sprite has more than a single
image, then a "strip" sprite will be created with all the images,
one after another, and the save file name will automatically be
appended with "<tt>_stripX</tt>", where "<tt>X</tt>" is the number
of frames exported. For example, a five frame sprite will be
exported as "<tt>sprite_name_strip5.png</tt>".<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Resize All Frames</b> - When you select this option it will
open the following window where you can set the way that you want
to resize all the animation frames that comprise the sprite:
<img class="center" src="images/editor_image_resizeframes.png" alt=
"Image Editor Resize Frames"> You can choose to either <b>Scale</b>
the image, or to <b>Resize</b> canvas. If you choose to scale
theimage then you simply select the new width and/or height for
each frame, whether to scale using the same aspect ratio, and also
whether to scale in pixels or percent. Note that when scaling you
can enable interpolation on or off, where having it on will case
the pixels to blur or "smear" as the image is scaled (in general,
for hi resolution art you want this on, but for pixel art you want
this off).<br>
<br>
The option to resize the canvas will not alter the pixels within
the image but instead increase or decrease the size of the canvas
that the images are being drawn on. You can set where the "anchor"
for the resize should be using the arrow icons, then set the new
size (in pixels or as a percentage) as well as set whether to
maintain the aspect ratio of the original frames. Note that making
the frame smaller than the original sprite images will crop the
pixels.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Crop All Frames To Selection</b> - This option will only be
available when you have an area of the image selected in the main
draw canvas. When you then choose this option, the image being
edited (and all other frames in the animation) will be cropped to
the boundaries of the selection.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Auto Trim All Frames</b> - This option permits you to trim
all the zero-alpha pixels from around the edges of a sprite. This
will take into consideration <i>all</i> image frames within the
sprite, so each side will crop to the edge of whichever frame has
the furthest non-zero alpha pixel. <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_image_trim.png" alt="Image Editor Trim Frames"></li>

<li><b>Reverse Frames</b> - Selecting this will simply reverse the
frame order for the sprite.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Mirror</b> - This option permits you to mirror either the
current frame all all the frames that comprise the sprite along the
vertical axis.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Flip</b> - This option permits you to flip either the
current frame all all the frames that comprise the sprite along the
horizontal axis.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Rotate all Frames (clockwise 90°)</b> - This option will
rotate all the frames of the animation 90° clockwise.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Rotate all Frames (anti-clockwise 90°)</b> - This option
will rotate all the frames of the animation 90°
anti-clockwise.</li>

<li><b>Fit Screen</b> - Scale the image to fill the image edit
window.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Toggle grid</b> - Toggle the pixel grid. This is the same as
the grid button found in the Canvas COntrols (explained further up
this page).<br>

set whether to only blur along the horizontal or vertical axis, or
along both. You can then choose to apply this to only the current
layer, visible layers or all layers. <img class="center" src=
