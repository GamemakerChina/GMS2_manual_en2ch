<h2>The Script Editor</h2>

<div class="body-scroll">

</p>

<p><img class="center" src="images/editor_scripts.png" alt=
"Script Editor">
</p>

<p>You can use code in a number of places within <i>GameMaker
Studio 2</i> from objects, to rooms, to instances, and there are a
number of built in functions that make your life easier when
programming with GML or Drag and Drop. However it is often
necessary for you to create your own functions to do a specific
task, or to condense a large section of code into a more manageable
chunk, or even to be able to re-use a particular code block in many
different places, which is why <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> gives you
the ability to create <b>scripts</b>.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: While this section deals with
scripts, the code window that you write your scripts in is the same
as that for <a href="objects.html#object_events">Events</a>,
<a href="rooms.html">room or instance creation code</a> or <a href=
"shaders.html">Shaders</a>, and the functionality outlined here
applies to all of them.</div>
<br>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: This page references GML for writing
scripts, but you can also create scripts using Drag and Drop (see
<a href=
"../../3_scripting/1_drag_and_drop_overview/action_scripts.html">here</a>)
. No matter what you use to code your project, the information on
this page is still valid for the editor itself.</div>
</blockquote>

<p>Scripts are written using the scripting language GML (see the
<a href="../../3_scripting/3_gml_overview/index.html">GML
Overview</a> section for more details), which is the built-in
programming language that <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> uses. Once you
become more familiar with <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> and want to use
it to its fullest extent, it is advisable to start learning to use
this language, as it greatly expands your possibilities when
creating games. You can also write scripts using Drag and Drop, but
that requires a different editor and is discussed in the section of
the manual for <a href=
"../../3_scripting/1_drag_and_drop_overview/action_scripts.html">Action
Scripts</a></p>

<p>A script (like any built-in function) can take different input
variables, with real, string, boolean and special values like
<tt>all</tt> or <tt>noone</tt> being accepted, and these input
variables are generally called <b>arguments</b>, although they are
also often referred to as <b>parameters</b>. To execute a script
from an object or a time line you use the script name as if it were
a function or by using the GML function <a href=
"../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/scripts/script_execute.html">script_execute</a>.
You can name the script by right-clicking <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_rmb.png"> on it in
the resource tree and selecting <b>Rename</b>, but note that the
script name must conform to the scripting rules for functions, so
they must start with a letter and only contain letters, numbers or
the "_" under-bar symbol.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, you can pass a number of arguments to a
script (16 in total), and it will use these to perform the task you
have written it for. To understand this better, take, for example,
an action (or a code in GML) and think about how it works... you
place it in an event and specify a number of parameters and it will
make your instance do something. Scripts are exactly the same, with
the only difference being that <i>you</i> write them. Not only can
you pass arguments into a script, but you can also ask a script to
<b>return</b> a value too (using the <a href=
"../../3_scripting/3_gml_overview/3_scripts.html#return"><tt>return</tt></a>
keyword), so you can use them to build calculating methods
(mathematical methods) or give back an instance id after a complex
collision detection or any number of things. Please note, however,
that <i>using return ends the script</i>, and so no code after it
has been used will be executed, and this means that a certain
amount of thought has to go into how your scripts are
structured.</p>

<p>When you first create a resource the script editor window will
open with the following options:</p>

<blockquote><a name="script_tabs" id="script_tabs"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="one">Script Tabs</label> <input id=
"one" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>The script editor opens in a window with tabs across the top to
let you have multiple scripts in one window (although this
behaviour can be changed from the <a href=
"../../1_overview/1_getting_started/preferences/prefs_general.html">
Preferences</a> to give a new window to each script). You can click
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png">
on a script and then drag it to re-order the tabs, or if you
prefer, you can pull it out of the current window and place it on
the workspace to create a new window for that script (or add it to
a different window). If you drag a script tab out of the IDE
window, then a new IDE will be spawned to hold this script
resource, and it can be used as you would the Main window.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="script_edition" id="script_edition"></a> <label class=
"collapse" for="two">Editing</label> <input id="two" type=
"checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>The main script editor is where you'll write all your code to
create the script.Scripts are written following the general rules
for GML syntax (see the <a href=
"../../3_scripting/3_gml_overview/index.html">GML Overview</a>
section for more details), and you can get help while writing your
scripts from the auto-complete window: <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_scripts_codecomplete.png" alt=
"Script Editor Code Complete"></p>

<p>This window will pop up while you are writing your code
(normally after a slight pause, but this can be set in the <a href=
"../../1_overview/1_getting_started/preferences/prefs_texteditor.html">
Preferences</a>) and give you a selection of "best-fit" answers in
alphabetical order. While using the code editor you can click
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png">
and drag the mouse to select a row of code or hold down <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_alt.png"> then click
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png">
and drag to select columns of code. Anything selected in this way
can then be copied, cut and pasted using the standard window
shortcuts of <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_ctrl.png"> + <tt>C</tt>, <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_ctrl.png"> +
<tt>X</tt> and <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_ctrl.png"> + <tt>V</tt>.</p>

<p>While writing your code, you may make mistakes or construct the
code incorrectly, in which case the IDE will inform you. This is
done in two ways, with the code editor flagging the line of code
that is causing the issue with a red (!) exclamation mark which you
can mouse over to get a brief description of what the issue is, and
with the syntax <a href="../2_tools/output.html">Output Window</a>
also showing the full error. <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_scripts_errors.png" alt=
"Script Editor Syntax Error"></p>

<p>It is worth noting that you can comment your code in various
ways. Commenting your code is very important for maintaining
productivity as it keeps things clear and separates sections of
code in such a way that it is obvious what each part does and why
it is there. It also means that if you are working in a team then
you can leave notes for other members and that they will know
exactly what you have done or what a specific section of code is
for. Even if you are a solo developer, leaving comments for your
code is important, especially if you have to leave the project and
come back to it at a later date.</p>

<p>Commenting your code is simple, as you just have to use
"<tt>//</tt>" before any line of text or you can comment out whole
paragraphs by using "<tt>/* text here */</tt>". There are even two
keyboard shortcuts to comment and uncomment selected lines of code:
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_ctrl.png"> + <tt>K</tt> to comment, and
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_ctrl.png"> + <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="../../images/icon_shift.png"> + <tt>K</tt> to uncomment. The
following image illustrates a script using both these methods:
<img class="center" src="images/editor_scripts_comments.png" alt=
"Script Editor Comments"></p>

<p>Scripts can also have certain <b>JSDoc</b> style comments added
so that when you use them in your code they show up in
auto-complete along with their arguments and other details. you can
find out more about this from the section <a href=
"../../1_overview/3_additional_information/jsdoc.html">JSDoc Script
Comments</a> for more information.</p>

<p>As you might have noticed, parts of the script text are
coloured. The script editor "knows" about existing objects,
built-in variables and functions, etc. and colour codes them
accordingly. Colour-coding helps a lot in avoiding mistakes as you
can see immediately if you have misspelled some name or use a
keyword as a variable, or have a syntax error. However, if you
don't like the colour coding, in the <a href=
"../../1_overview/1_getting_started/preferences/prefs_texteditor.html">
Preferences</a> you can switch it on and off (you can also use F10)
as well as customise the colours that are used.</p>

<p>You can right-click <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_rmb.png"> anywhere in the editor too to open up
the following menu: <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_scripts_rmb_menu.png" alt="Script Editor Menu"></p>

<p>Apart from the regular functions you'd expect to cut, copy and
paste lines of code you also have the option to comment or
uncomment any selected text, add or remove indents, as well split
the code window into 1, 2 or 3 separate panes. These last options
will split the window into different parts where you can then drag
a script and have it show alongside the other ones for comparing
and editing. <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_scripts_panes.png" alt="Script Editor Panes"></p>

<p>This is exceptionally useful for comparing two scripts or for
viewing connected scripts at the same time, without needing another
window or having to switch constantly between tabs. The other
options in this menu are to toggle a breakpoint for use with the
Debugger, and to convert the GML code into DnD™ or vice versa. Note
that if converting code to DnD™, then it will <i>not</i> create
individual actions for each line of code, but rather use a single
code action to hold everything that was previously in the event or
script.</p>

<p>Another very handy tool you have at your disposal when editing
your scripts is the use of <b>Code Snippets</b>. By pressing
<tt>F2</tt> you will open the code snippet pop-up, which permits
you to select one of the commonly used code methods. You can also
define your <i>own</i> code snippets if you want to, saving them to
the directory where you installed <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> in the
following location: <tt>\GameMaker Studio
2\TextEditor\snippets.txt</tt>. You can edit this file with any
text editor following these rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each snippet is on a separate line (there should be no blank
lines).</li>

<li>Each snippet starts with the name of the snippet (which is what
is shown in the menu) followed by the colon (:) followed by the
actual snippet of code.</li>

<li>Use # for a newline and put the text that needs to be selected
first between | symbols.</li>
</ul>

<p>See the examples that are already in the file to see how it is
set up following the rules above, and it is strongly recommended
that you make a backup of it before you start changing anything,
and also back up any edits you make to the file, as should
re-installing the program or updating it revert the changes that
you make you can use the backup to redo them again.</p>

<p>The information bar at the bottom of the IDE shows you the
current line number you are on and the position along the line. It
is also where you can see the code helper, which is a line of text
that shows the function you are currently editing along with the
arguments it requires. As you fill in the function in the editor,
the arguments will highlight to show you which one you are
currently editing. If you have used the <a href=
"../../1_overview/3_additional_information/jsdoc.html">JSDoc Script
Comments</a> within a custom script then the information you have
supplied will also show here.</p>
