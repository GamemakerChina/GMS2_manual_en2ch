<h2>The Object Editor</h2>

<div class="body-scroll">

<p><img class="center" src="images/editor_objects.png" alt=
"Object Editor"> Objects are the resource that we use to control
aspects of a game and to do specific things. Most of the time they
have a sprite associated with them so that you see them in the game
rooms, but sometimes they are used as a "behind the scenes"
controller to do things related to the user or for timing, etc...
They can be given behaviours and they can react to certain events
as well as to each other, and most of the things you see in a game
are based on objects and their interactions. Now, we say "based on"
because you don't actually place objects directly into the game
rooms, but rather you place <b>instances</b> of these objects which
are basically copies (or clones if you prefer) of the object
resource. This is a very important thing to remember as instances
and objects are <i>not the same thing</i> and each have their own
set of functions that can affect them.</p>

<p>To clarify this, think of a game made with <i>GameMaker Studio
2</i>. All the characters, monsters, balls, walls, etc... are all
objects you create in the resource tree. You then drag the object
into a room in the <a href="rooms.html">Room Editor</a> to create
an <b>instance</b> copied from the basic object template. The
instance in the room can then be changed in the editor itself or
through code, so that it can be scaled, or coloured, or have other
details modified from the "base" object. So when we talk about
something affecting or changing an instance, we mean it affects
that <i>one particular copy of an object in a room</i>. Only that
single instance is being affected while all the rest are not. But,
when we talk about affecting or changing an <b>object</b>, we mean
that we are modifying the object in the resource tree and anything
we do to it will be reflected in all the instances created from
that point on too. So, the object is the template for the instance,
and the instance is what we place in a room to make our game.</p>

<p>To create an object in your game, you can right click
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_rmb.png">
on the object resource folder and click the <i>Create</i> option.
This will open the window pictured at the top of this page with the
following sections:</p>

<blockquote><a name="object_details" id="object_details"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="one">Details</label> <input id="one"
type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>Here you can give your object a name. This name should never
contain spaces nor unauthorized characters (only alpha-numeric
characters and the underbar "_" are allowed) and should be short
but memorable so that you can easily identify resources later when
you may have many of them. For example many people use a prefix or
a suffix to identify the differences between resources, like
"obj_Ship" or "Ship_obj".</p>

<p>Next you can choose the sprite for the object should you wish it
to have one. Click with the left mouse button <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png"> on the
sprite box and the <b>Asset Explorer</b> will appear with a list of
all the available sprites from the resource tree: <img class=
"center" src="images/editor_objects_assetexplorer.png" alt=
"Asset Explorer"></p>

<p>You can then select the one you want to use for the object. With
a sprite assigned to the object you can click the Edit Sprite
button <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_editsprite.png"> to change the sprite properties, or
if you do not have a sprite for the object but wish to create one
you can click the Add Sprite button <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="images/icon_newsprite.png"> to create
a new sprite resource and assign that. You can also edit the sprite
resource image that has been assigned by clicking the Edit Image
button <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_editimage.png"> to open the Image Editor.</p>

<a name="object_collision_mask" id="object_collision_mask"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="nineteen">Collision Mask</label>
<input id="nineteen" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>Beneath the sprite assignment area you have a button for
choosing a specific <b>Collision Mask</b>. By default an object
will use the collision properties of the sprite assigned to it, but
there are cases whereby you may want collisions to be based off of
a different mask shape. For example, you may have a top down game
where the main sprite has a rectangular collision mask, but to make
collisions smoother a circular mask may be better. In these cases
you can click the Collision Mask button and select another sprite
resource, so now instances of the object will <i>draw</i> the
assigned sprite, but base collisions off of the <i>mask</i>
sprite.</p>

<label class="collapse" for="two">Properties</label> <input id=

<blockquote><a name="object_visible" id="object_visible"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="four">Visible</label> <input id="four"
type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p><b>Visible</b> indicates whether instances of this object are
visible when the room starts. Normally most instances are visible
but sometimes it is useful to have invisible ones - for example,
you can use them for way-points to control a moving monster, or to
keep track values and perform certain timed actions. Invisible
objects will still react to events and if they have a sprite or a
mask assigned to them, they will also react should other instances
collide with them... they just cannot be seen and do not perform
their <b>draw</b> event. By default, the visible flag is
checked.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="object_solid" id="object_solid"></a> <label class=
"collapse" for="a">Solid</label> <input id="a" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>When you flag an instance as being solid, you are telling
<i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> that it should try to resolve any
collisions before triggering a <b>collision event</b>. This is a
<i>very</i> basic functionality, and in reality all it does is move
the instance back to the position it was in the moment before a
collision was detected before performing any code or DnD™ that is
in the event itself, and as such is of limited use.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="object_persistence" id="object_persistence"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="five">Persistent</label> <input id=
"five" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p><b>Persistent</b> - A persistent object is one that does not go
away when the room is changed, but rather it "persists" and is
carried over into the new room. It will only disappear when you
explicitly destroy it, either with a destroy action or in code.
This means that if you place a persistent object in one room, it
will still be available in all subsequent rooms and will continue
to perform any actions assigned to the events in its object
properties, <i>except</i> the create event, which is only fired
once when it is created initially and not when you change to a new
room.</p>

<p>This is handy for when you have, for example, a main character
that moves from room to room and you want to maintain the variables
within that object the same, but you should take great care to
create and destroy persistent objects correctly as you can easily
get errors creeping into your project by mistake.</p>

<p>Note too that a persistent object will still have its Game
Start, Game End, Room Start and Room End events triggered, however
if you restart the game (with, for example, the game_restart()
function) all persistent objects will be removed and only exist
when created again by the game. Also note that if you deactivate a
persistent object, it will no longer pass from one room to another
unless re-activated before the Room End event is triggered.</p>

<p>When you check the <b>Uses Physics</b> box you are telling
<i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> that this object should be part of a
<a href="rooms.html#room_physics">physics world</a>. Checking this
will also open a further chained window where you can define the

</p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<p>The options section defines the different property options for
your object and how the instances will behave when placed in a
room. Here you add events, which are the "building blocks" of your
game code, set whether the object is to have a parent and also set
the physics properties if you want to enable the physics
functions.</p>

<blockquote><a name="object_events" id="object_events"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="seven">Events</label> <input id=
"seven" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>So, what are events? Basically, these are discreet moments in
the game loop where things are made to happen based on what you
have programmed for them. <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> works with
cycles of these events - from the moment a room is started to the
moment it is finished there is a game loop running where every
<b>step</b> (a step is a moment in game time, governed by the room
speed setting) a series of events are run or checked, and you can
choose to place code or DnD actions in your objects that respond to
these events.</p>

<p>Let's look at a typical object setup with events and code:
<img class="center" src="images/editor_objects_events.png" alt=
"Object Editor Events View"></p>

<p>As you can see in our example object there are a number of
events listed that it should respond to, but initially when you
create an object this list is empty and you must decide which
events you need and what instances of that object should do when
those events are triggered. To add events into the object, you
press the <b>Add Event</b> button found at the bottom of the events
list which will bring up the following window: <img class="center"
src="images/editor_objects_eventlist.png" alt=
"Object Editor Events List"></p>

<p>That is the list of all the basic events which an object can
respond to, although some of those events also have <b>sub
events</b> to further refine behaviours. For example, if you add a
Key Press <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"events/images/icon_keyboardpress.png"> event you will then get a
further window popping up with the sub events that allow you to
select which key the object should respond to. Once you have
selected your event, the <a href="scripts.html">code window</a>
will be chained to it and open up on the right. You can now edit
the code to give your object a specific behaviour or reaction to
that event.</p>

<p>You can click the right mouse button <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_rmb.png"> on any
event to get the following menu options: <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_objects_rmbmenu.png" alt=
"Object Editor Events Menu"></p>

<p>These options are:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Add Event</b> - Add a new event from the event list.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Cut / Copy / Paste Events</b> - Cut, copy or paste the
selected event. You can use the standard keyboard shortcuts too:
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_ctrl.png"> + <tt>X</tt>, <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_ctrl.png"> +
<tt>C</tt>, and <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_ctrl.png"> + <tt>V</tt>.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Duplicate Event</b> - Duplicate the chosen event. This will
take the contents of the chosen event and duplicate them in another
event that you specify.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Change Event</b> - Change the event. This will prompt you to
choose another event category and once selected the contents of the
current event will be changed to the new event (removing the
original event in the process).<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Convert To Drag and Drop / Code</b> - Object events will be
created using the method chosen when you created the project,
either using code or using Drag and Drop actions. With this option
you can convert from one to the other, regardless of the project
type.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Delete Event</b> - Delete the event (or events).</li>
</ul>

<p>When removing events, you can use <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_shift.png"> +
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png">
to select multiple events and then delete them all together.</p>

<p>You should also note that you can <b>name events</b>, or at
least give them a short descriptive text that will be shown beside
them in the Event Editor. To do this, simply add the following into
the very first line of the code editor for the event:</p>

<p class="code">/// @description Your text here</p>

<p>So, you could have something like this in - for example - an
Alarm event</p>

<p class="code">/// @description This is the AI Fight alarm</p>

<p>And now in your Event Editor you'll see this: <img class=
"center" src="images/editor_objects_namedevents.png" alt=
"Object Editor Named Events"></p>
</div>
<br></blockquote>

<p>Note that the section on events above simply gives an overview
of how they work, but for full details on all the avaialble events,
please see the following section:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><a href="events/index.html"><span class="list_link">Object
Events List</span></a>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The other options for an object are:</p>

<blockquote><a name="object_parent" id="object_parent"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="eight">Parent</label> <input id=
"eight" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>When working with objects in the <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> IDE,
you can set up <b>Parent / Child hierarchies</b>. This is done by
clicking the "Parent" button in the object editor and then choosing
another object from the resource tree to be the "parent" of the one
being edited: <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_objects_parent.png" alt="Parents"></p>

<p>So, every object in your game project can have a parent object,
but what does this mean? Well, when an object has a parent assigned
it can share code, actions and events with that parent. This
sharing is called "inheritance" and an object that has a parent is
called a "child" object. Not only can a child share code with its
parent, but you can do checks and run code on parent objects and it
will automatically include the child objects too, which saves a lot
of time and energy.</p>

<p>If that sounds complicated, then another way to look at a parent
object is as a way to "group" objects together under the same
umbrella and have them share certain things without losing their
own unique identity. Maybe that still doesn't clarify things too
much, so let's give some examples...</p>

<p>Say you have a "player" object and four different "enemy"
objects. Now, you want the player to die if he touches any of these
four objects and this would normally entail four different
collision events with four different sets of actions or code, one
for each of the enemy objects. BUT if we make a <i>parent</i>
object for all the enemies, then we can create one collision event
with the parent object only and it will trigger no matter which one
of the four "child" enemy objects touch the player. Handy stuff! In
the actual <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> object you would see something
like this: <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_object_parentcollision.png" alt="Parents"></p>

<p>On the left we have four separate collision events and on the
right we have a single collision event, as we have created a
"parent" object and assigned all the enemy objects to it. Note that
a parent object doesn't have to have any events or code in
it...</p>

<p>Another example of parenting would be if you have a game where
you want to create 10 different looking objects and have them all
behave in the same way. For that you would create one parent object
and in that have all your behaviour actions or code in the required
events, and then you would create your ten objects with <i>no</i>
actions or code, but different sprites, and assign them your parent
object. Now, when you place these instances in a room they will all
behave the same, but look different, since they will "inherit" the
events of the parent.</p>

<p>Finally you can use parenting to "mix and match" events and
behaviours. We'll illustrate this with one final example... Say you
want two monsters: one that moves up and down, while another that
moves left and right, but you also want the two of them to have the
same health, shoot at the player and hurt the player if they
collide with them. In this case you can see that almost all events
should have the same actions except for one or two that govern
movement. So, again, we can make one object the parent of the
other, but in this case we also define certain events for the child
object. These events "override" the parent events, meaning that
whenever an event for the child object contains actions, these are
executed instead of the actions contained in the event of the
parent. If you also want to execute the parent event you can call
the so-called "inherited" event using the appropriate action or
code. <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_object_inheritevents.png" alt=
"Inheriting Events"></p>

<p>On the left above is the parent object with 5 events in it, and
on the right you can see the "child" object. This child only has 2
events defined, but it will inherit the events of the parent and so
have 5, exactly the same. The difference now is that the events
that the child has added (<b>step</b> and <b>draw</b>) will
override the ones in the parent event.</p>

<p>As indicated, wherever you use a parent object, this also
applies to the descendants (or "children"). This happens when, in
an action, you indicate that the action must be applied to
instances of a certain object. It also happens when you use the
<tt>with()</tt> statement in code (see the manual for further
details), and it works when you call code functions like <a href=
"../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/instances/instance_functions/instance_position.html">
<tt>instance_position</tt></a>, <a href=
"../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/instances/instance_functions/instance_number.html">
<tt>instance_number</tt></a>, etc... where if you supply a parent
object then it and all child instances will be included in the
checks. Finally, parenting works when you refer to variables in
other objects too, like in the above monster example if I set the
enemy 1 speed to 10, then the enemy 2 speed will also go to ten as
it is a child object of enemy 1.</p>

<p>It is generally considered good practice in most cases to create
one base parent object and have this base object contain all the
default behaviour but never use an instance of it in the game.
Rather use all the children objects and only use the parent in
situations like those I have outlined above, for collision, for
referencing variables, etc... You should also realise that parents
can have parents too! Obviously you can't create a cycle of "parent
1 is child of parent 2 is child of parent 1" but you can create
what is called "object hierarchy" where "parent1 is child of
parent2 is child of parent3". This is extremely useful to keep your
game structured and you are strongly advised to learn to use this
mechanism.</p>

<div class="index_list">When you first create a new object
resource, there is a check-box marked <b>Uses Physics</b>, which is
not checked by default. Selecting this option will radically change
the behaviour of your object when an instance of it is placed in a
room, as this switches on the object's physical properties and
means that its "traditional" movement and collision functions are
no longer valid (but only when the room it is placed on is also
marked as being a physics room. See - <a href="rooms.html">The Room
Editor</a>). When you check this, the object resource window opens
a new chained window for the physics editor: <img class="center"
src="images/editor_objects_physics.png" alt=
"Object Editor Physics"> Before you start to edit the values for
the physics behaviours it's a good idea to first set the
<b>collision shape</b>. With the "normal" collision system your
collisions are based off of the mask of the sprite assigned to the
object, but with physics enabled this is no longer the case. We
need to assign a <b>collision shape</b> the object ourselves (this
is properly called a <b>fixture</b>, see <a href=
"../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/physics/index.html">The Physics
Functions</a> for more information), which can either be a circle,
a rectangle or a polygon shape that you yourself define. Clicking
on the <b>Modify Collision Shape</b> button will open the following
chained window to edit the shape: <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_objects_physicsshape.png" alt=
"Object Editor Physics Shape Editor"> This looks similar to the
<a href="paths.html">Path Editor</a>, and functions in much the
same way. However, depending on the mask you have chosen, it can be
rather more restrictive:<br>
<br>

<ul>
<li>If you have a <b>circular</b> mask, then you can only pull any
of the path points to make the circle diameter larger or
smaller</li>

<li>If you have <b>rectangular</b> mask, then you can move any of
the four corners, but the corresponding ones will adjust position
automatically to always maintain a rectangle</li>

<li>If you have a <b>custom</b> (polygon) mask, it must have a
minimum of 3 and a maximum of 8 points to it, and it must be convex
(see image below).</li>
</ul>
<img class="center" src="images/editor_object_physicsshape.png"

large space, while a lead bar would have a high density as it has a
great mass, yet occupies little space. In the <i>GameMaker Studio
2</i> 2D physics world, mass is calculated automatically for you
from the values you input for the density and by the surface area
of the shape you define for the fixture. This will have a direct
impact on how much inertia a fixture has as well as how it reacts
to collisions and forces, so if you make a small shape with a high
density it will have a very large mass (like a bar of lead), but if
you define a large shape with a low density it will have a much
smaller mass (like a balloon).</div>

specify that an object should belong to a specific <b>collision

fixtures bound to them. So, when two instances collide, their
motion is affected by this value, with a high friction causing a
larger loss of momentum than a lower value.</div></blockquote>

<p>Finally there are three extra options that can flagged as on or
off for your fixture, Sensor, Start Awake and Kinematic. Each of
these flags will change the behaviour of your fixture in the
following ways:</p>

<blockquote><a name="object_physics_sensor" id=
"object_physics_sensor"></a> <label class="collapse" for=
"sixteen">Sensor</label> <input id="sixteen" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">By checking this box, you are telling
GameMaker Studio 2 to basically "ignore" the physical properties of
the object, but still return a collision event with the objects
around it. in this way you can have an instance with no physical
presence in the room, but which can react to the collision of
another instance, like the player, and do something in turn, like
open a door, or trigger some sort of action in another place in the
room.<br>
<br>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: A sensor fixture will fire off the
collision event when the collision <b>first occurs only</b>,
meaning you don't get a stream of collision events as the two
bodies continue to overlap (which is what would traditionally
occur). If they stop overlapping and overlap subsequently there
will be another collision event triggered.</div></div>
<br>
<a name="object_physics_awake" id="object_physics_awake"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="seventeen">Start Awake</label>
<input id="seventeen" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">This is checked by default and represents
the initial "state" of the fixture at the start of the room it has
been placed in. Normally you want it to be awake (ie: participating
in the physics world) right from the start, but sometimes this can
lead to certain instabilities and unwanted effects due to the
abrupt start of the physics simulation. To avoid these effects, you
can un-check this flag and the instance will be created with the
fixture asleep, and it will not participate in the physics
simulation unless something acts upon it.</div>
<br>
<a name="object_physics_kinematic" id=
"object_physics_kinematic"></a> <label class="collapse" for=
"eitghteen">Kinematic</label> <input id="eitghteen" type=
"checkbox">
<div class="index_list">There will be certain instances in a
physics based game which you want to move around but do not wish to
be acted on by forces such as gravity, nor forces incurred by
collisions with dynamic objects (think of moving platforms in a
platform game, for example). For such objects simply setting the
density of the fixture to 0 will mean that the physics will assume
that the object is intended to be static and it will not react at
all to anything. However, checking this box will make a static
object kinematic and although it will be unaffected by collisions
and gravity, it can still be moved around or rotated using the
appropriate variables.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote>
