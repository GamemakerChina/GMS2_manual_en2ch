<h2>The Asynchronous Events</h2>

<div class="body-scroll">
<p><img class="center" src="images/editor_objects_async.png" alt=
"Object Editor Async Events"> An <b>asynchronous event</b> is one
that is fired off when <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> receives a "call
back" from some external source, which can be from the web or from
the device running your game. Basically, you tell <i>GameMaker
Studio 2</i> to do something, like load an image, and it'll start
to do this but continue doing whatever it else it has to do
meanwhile its working. Then, when the request has been completed, a
call-back will be sent to <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> and any
<b>Asynchronous Events</b> defined for that type of call back will
be fired. Please note that the Asynchronous Events are fired for
<i>all</i> instances that have them, much like the key events, so
you can do an <tt>http_get</tt> call in one instance, yet have the
Asynchronous HTTP event in another to deal with the call
back.<br></p>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: You should be aware that due to XSS
protection in browsers, requests to and attempts to load resources
from across domains are blocked and may appear to return blank
results when using any of the following events</div>

<p><br>
There are various types of events associated with the Asynchronous
event category, and they are all explained in the sections
below:</p>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> The variable <tt>async_load</tt>
which is mentioned in the following sections is <b>only valid in
these events</b>, as the <tt>ds_map</tt> that is points to is
created at the start of the event, then deleted again at the end,
with this variable being reset to a value of -1 at all other
times.</div>

<p><br>
</p>

<blockquote><a name="async_audio_play" id="async_audio_play"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="thirteen">Audio Playback</label>
<input id="thirteen" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">This event can only be triggered by the
<a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/audio/audio%20buffers.html">audio
queue play functions</a> and will return a <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/data_structures/ds%20maps/index.html">
<tt>ds_map</tt></a> stored in the variable <tt>async_load</tt>,
containing different key/value pairs relating to the audio queue
that has triggered the event. The event is triggered when you have
selected an audio queue to playback and a buffer in that audio
queue is finished playing.<br>
<br>
The following keys will be available in the ds_map:<br>
<br>

<ul>
<li>"<b>queue_id</b>" - the queue index for the queue that has
finished playing, as returned by the function <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/audio/audio_create_play_queue.html">
<tt>audio_create_play_queue</tt></a>.</li>

<li>"<b>buffer_id</b>" - the buffer ID for the buffer that is no
longer being played from</li>

<li>"<b>queue_shutdown</b>" - this is set to 0 during normal
playback and 1 when the event is received because <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/audio/audio_free_play_queue.html">
<tt>audio_free_play_queue</tt></a> has been called. When this is
set to 1, you don't want to queue up any further data.</li>
</ul>
Since an audio queue can be created from multiple buffers, this
event can be triggered multiple times for one queue as the end of
each section of buffered audio is reached, hence the "buffer_id"
key.<br>
<br>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> The variable <tt>async_load</tt> is
only valid in the asynchronous events, as the <tt>ds_map</tt> that
is points to is created at the start of the event, then deleted
again at the end, with this variable being reset to a value of -1.
However, all further data-structures created from the event <b>must
be cleaned up using the appropriate functions</b>.</div>
<br>
In the example of use given below we will create an audio queue
with 10 buffered audio sounds added to it and then play the
queue:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">audio_queue = audio_create_play_queue(buffer_s16,
11052, audio_mono);<br>
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++;)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;audio_queue_sound(audio_queue, audio_buffer[i],
0, buffer_get_size(audio_buffer[i]));<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
audio_play_sound(audio_queue, 0, true);<br></p>
<br>
Every game step now that the recording is detected will trigger an
asynchronous Audio Recording event where you can deal with the
recorded input something like this:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">var queue = async_load[? "queue_id"];<br>
var num = 0;<br>
if queue = audio_queue<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++;)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if async_load[? "buffer_id"] ==
audio_buffer[i]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;buffer_seek(audio_buffer[i],
buffer_seek_start, 0);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;num = i;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if num == 9<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;audio_stop_sound(audio_queue);<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;audio_free_play_queue(audio_queue);<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br></p>
<br>
Here we check the queue ID and if it's the one we want, we then
check the buffer ID to see which buffer has finished being played.
We also then set a local var to that index value for checking later
and set the buffer back to the start for that sound. Once our local
variable reaches 9, indicating that the queue has finished, we stop
the sound playing and free the queue.</div>
<br>
<a name="async_audio_rec" id="async_audio_rec"></a> <label class=
"collapse" for="twelve">Audio Recording</label> <input id="twelve"
type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">This event can only be triggered by the
<a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/audio/audio_start_recording.html">
<tt>audio_start_recording()</tt></a> function and will return a
<a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/data_structures/ds%20maps/index.html">
<tt>ds_map</tt></a> stored in the variable <tt>async_load</tt>,
containing different key/value pairs depending on the call-back
from the function that has triggered the event.<br>
<br>
The following keys will be available in the ds_map:<br>
<br>

<ul>
<li>"<b>buffer_id</b>" - the ID of the temporary buffer you can use
to retrieve the audio data</li>

<li>"<b>channel_index</b>" - the recording channel index as
returned by the calling function that this data came from</li>

<li>"<b>data_len</b>" - the length of data (in bytes) you've
received</li>
</ul>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> As mentioned at the start of this
page, the variable <tt>async_load</tt> is only valid in the
asynchronous events, as the <tt>ds_map</tt> that is points to is
created at the start of the event, then deleted again at the end.
However, note that the temporary buffer in which all audio is
stored with the map will also be removed at the end of the event so
you should copy it to a custom buffer if you want to keep it for
later use.</div>
<br>
In the usage example below we will create a custom buffer to store
our recorded audio, and also set our game to record from input
source 0:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">channel_index = audio_start_recording(0);<br>
audio_buffer = buffer_create(len, buffer_fast, 1);<br></p>
<br>
Every game step now that the recording is detected will trigger an
asynchronous Audio Recording event where you can deal with the
recorded input something like this:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">var channel = async_load[? "channel_index"];<br>
if channel == channel_index<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;len = async_load[? "data_len"];<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;buffer_copy(async_load[? "buffer_id"], 0, len,
audio_buffer, 0);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br></p>
<br>
Here we simply check the "channel_index" key to make sure it
matches the value returned when we started recording, and if it
does we copy the contents of the temporary buffer created for this
event into our custom buffer. After that you can do what you want
with the custom buffer - you could play it using the dedicated
buffer audio functions, you could process it and send it over the
network, you could save it to disk... Once you have your recorded
audio in a buffer, you can do basically anything you want.</div>
<br>
<a name="async_cloud" id="async_cloud"></a> <label class="collapse"
for="five">Cloud</label> <input id="five" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">The Cloud Event is one that is triggered by
the call back from one of the <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/asynchronous%20functions/index.html">
<tt>cloud_</tt> functions</a>, like <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/asynchronous%20functions/cloud_synchronise.html">
<tt>cloud_synchronise</tt></a>. It actually generates a
<tt>ds_map</tt> that is exclusive to this event and is stored in
the special variable <b>async_load</b> (please see the individual
functions for code examples that explain the use of this event in
further detail). This ds_map has the following structure:<br>
<br>

<ul>
<li><b>"status":</b> This holds the status code, where a negative
value denotes an error, a description of which will be contained in
the “errorString”. A value of 0 (or a positive value) indicates a
success(see below for exact values), and the “resultString” will
contain the returned data or a success message.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>"id":</b> The id which was returned from the called
function. If you fire off a series of <tt>cloud_</tt> requests then
you need to know which one you are getting the reply to, and so you
would use this value to compare to the value you stored when you
originally sent the request to find the right one.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>"description":</b> The description of the last uploaded

<a name="async_dialogue" id="async_dialogue"></a> <label class=
"collapse" for="three">Dialogue</label> <input id="three" type=
"checkbox">
<div class="index_list">Like the above events, the <b>Dialogues</b>
event is only triggered when it gets a call back from one of the
special asynchronous user functions, like <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/asynchronous%20functions/get_login_async.html">
<tt>get_login_async()</tt></a> (please see this function for an
extended code example of how this event is used). These events are
the ones that ask for some type of user input, which can be a name,
login details, a number or a colour etc... As most devices do not
like sitting in a loop waiting for a reply, they have to be
asynchronous and <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> will continue to run in
the background while these functions have a dialogue open and until
they get the required user input which triggers this event.<br>
<br>
Again, a <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/data_structures/ds%20maps/index.html">
<tt>ds_map</tt></a> is returned with the id held in the special
variable <b>async_load</b>. The values held in this map will depend
on the function used, and you should consult the individual entries
for each function in this manual for more details.</div>
<br>
<a name="async_http" id="async_http"></a> <label class="collapse"
for="two">HTTP</label> <input id="two" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">The HTTP Event is one that is triggered by
the call back from one of the <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/asynchronous%20functions/index.html">
<tt>http_</tt> functions</a>, like <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/asynchronous%20functions/http_post_string.html">
<tt>http_post_string</tt></a>. It actually generates a
<tt>ds_map</tt> (sometimes known as a "dictionary") that is
exclusive to this event and is stored in the special variable
<tt>async_load</tt> (please see the individual functions for code
examples that explain the use of this event in further detail).
This <tt>ds_map</tt> has the following structure:<br>
<br>

<ul>
<li><b>"id":</b> The id which was returned from the command. If you
fire off a series of <tt>http_</tt> requests then you need to know
which one you are getting the reply to, and so you would use this
value to compare to the value you stored when you originally sent
the request to find the right one.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>"status":</b> Returns a value of less than 0 for an error, 0
for success and 1 if content is being downloaded.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>"result":</b> The data received (string only), or the path
to the file downloaded if you have used <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/asynchronous%20functions/http_get_file.html">
<tt>http_get_file()</tt></a>.</li>

</li>

<li><b>"url":</b> The complete URL you requested.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>"http_status":</b> The raw http status code (if available).
This returns the standard web status code for most browsers, eg:
304 for "Not Modified" or 204 for "No Content", etc...</li>
</ul>
That is for when you use the <tt>http_post_string()</tt> function,
but each of the <tt>http_</tt> functions may return a slightly
different map, so please refer to the manual entry for each
function to find out the precise data that is returned for it.<br>
<br>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> As <tt>async_load</tt> creates a
<a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/data_structures/ds%20maps/index.html">
<tt>ds_map</tt></a>, these functions are particularly useful when
coupled with the <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/file%20handling/json_encode.html">
<tt>json_encode</tt></a> and <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/file%20handling/json_decode.html">
<tt>json_decode</tt></a> functions.</div>
<br>
<br>
There could also be additional data supplied by this map if you
have requested files for downloading. In this case, the "status"
will have a value of 1 and the ds_map will hold these extra
keys:<br>
<br>

<ul>
<li><b>"contentLength":</b> This is the size of file that the web
server has said you should expect to receive (may be -1 if the
server does not return this data).</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>"sizeDownloaded":</b> The size of the data that has already
been downloaded.</li>
</ul>
Note that the event will <i>not</i> be triggered for every single
data packet that is received, but will rather update at any time
during the download within the main game loop. Also note that
currently this functionality is only available for regular
<i>Windows</i> target platforms.</div>

<p>This will now start to load the image into the device or the
browser, but it will <i>not</i> block <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i>
while it waits for the file to be loaded. Instead <i>GameMaker
Studio 2</i> will keep running as normal until the image is loaded
and the call back triggers the <b>Image Loaded</b> event, where a
<a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/data_structures/ds%20maps/index.html">
<tt>ds_map</tt></a> is created and stored in the special variable
<b>async_load</b>. The map contains the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>"filename":</b> The complete path to the file you
requested.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>"id":</b> The ID of the resource that you have loaded. This
will be the same as the variable that you have assigned the
resource to.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>"status":</b> Returns a value of less than 0 for an
error.</li>
</ul>

<p>You would then assign the newly loaded image to a background in
this event. The above is also true for sprites and sounds, with a
ds_map being generated for each of these resources as shown above,
and the following code example demonstrates how the returned
information would be used in this event:</p>

<p class="code">if ds_map_find_value(async_load, "id") == spr<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ds_map_find_value(async_load, "status") &gt;=
0<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sprite_index = spr<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br></p>

<p>The above code will first check the id of the ds_map that has
been created, then check the status of the callback. If the value
is greater than or equal to 0 (signalling success) the result from
the callback will then be used to set the background index to the
newly loaded image.</p></div>

<div class="index_list">The Push Notification Event is one that is
triggered by the call back from <b>push notifications</b> on the
device OS, either from a local source using the function <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/asynchronous%20functions/push_local_notification.html">
<tt>push_local_notification</tt></a>, or from a remote source (ie:
your server). It generates a <tt>ds_map</tt> that is exclusive to
this event and is stored in the special variable <b>async_load</b>
(please see the individual functions that trigger asynchronous
events for code examples that explain the use of this event in
further detail). This <tt>ds_map</tt> has the following keys:<br>
<br>

<ul>
<li><b>"type":</b> Value can be "local" for a device local
notification, "remote" for a remote notification, or "register" for
remote notification registration.</li>

<li><b>"status":</b> Value will be "1" for success or "0" for an
error.</li>
</ul>
There may be additional key entries based on the "type" returned
and the "status" value. For "status", if an error has been returned
("0"), then you will also have the following key:<br>
<br>

<ul>
<li><b>"error":</b> Contains details of the error received.</li>
</ul>
If the "status" value is 1 (ie: no errors) then the <tt>ds_map</tt>
will contain the following additional values, depending on the
value of the "type" key:<br>
<br>

<ul>
<li><b>"reg_id":</b> If the "type" received was "register", then
this key will hold the device registration id for remote
notifications.</li>

<li><b>"data":</b> If the "type" received was "local" or "remote",
then this key will hold the string payload that you defined when
you called the notification function.</li>
</ul>
To understand this better, we have created a small example snippet
below for you to look at. In this example we will send a local push
notification using the following code:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">var fireTime =
date_inc_day(date_current_datetime(), 1);<br>
var data = "daily_reward";<br>
push_local_notification(fireTime, "Ahoy!", "Catch The Haggis Has A
Present", data);<br></p>
<br>
This will set a timer to "push" a notification to the device when
one day has passed. When the day is up, if your game is either in
the background or not running, a notification will be shown to the
user with the given title and message (on iOS, the game name is
shown and the title is ignored), and then an asynchronous Push
Notification Event will be called. Note that if the game is in the
foreground when the time for the notification comes, it will
<i>not</i> be shown, but the asynchronous event <b>will still
trigger</b>. In the event itself you would handle the callback
something like this:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">var type = ds_map_find_value(async_load,
"type");<br>
var status = ds_map_find_value(async_load, "status");<br>
if status == 0<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//error of some kind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var error = ds_map_find_value(async_load,
"error");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;show_debug_message("error=" + string(error));<br>

<li>"<b>entries</b>" - A JSON object string that contains another
ds_map, which will either contain the key "default" (signifying
that no results are contained within) or the key "entries", which
you can then get the value of. this returned value for "entries"
will be a <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/data_structures/ds%20lists/index.html">
<tt>ds_list</tt></a> containing each of the ranks from the
leaderboard, where each entry in the list will itself reference
another <tt>ds_map</tt> which will contain the keys "name", "score"
and "rank", and it may also contain a "data" key depending on the
function used to upload.</li>
</ul>
We will show an example of how downloading score data works by
requesting the top ten ranking for the given leaderboard and
parsing its results in the <b>Steam Async Event</b> (for uploading
examples, please see the appropriate function pages). To start with
we need to request the scores with the following code:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">score_get = steam_download_scores("Game Scores", 1,
10);<br></p>
<br>
This will send off a request to the Steam Server for the scores
from the leaderboard "Game Scores", storing the <b>async ID</b> of
the request in the variable "score_get". This will then be handled
in the <b>Steam Async Event</b> in the following way:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">var async_id = ds_map_find_value(async_load,
"id");<br>
if async_id == score_get<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var entries = ds_map_find_value(async_load,
"entries");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var map = json_decode(entries);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ds_map_exists(map, "default")<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ds_map_destroy(map);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exit;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var list =
ds_map_find_value(map, "entries");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var len =
ds_list_size(list);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var entry;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for(var i = 0; i &lt; len;
i++;)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entry =
ds_list_find_value(list, i );<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;steam_name[i]
= ds_map_find_value(entry, "name");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;steam_score[i]
= ds_map_find_value(entry, "score");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;steam_rank[i]
= ds_map_find_value(entry, "rank");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if
(ds_map_exists(entry, "data"))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var
data = ds_map_find_value(entry, "data");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var
buffId = buffer_base64_decode(data);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var
message = buffer_read(buffId, buffer_string);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;show_debug_message(
" -- attached message: " + string(message));<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;buffer_delete(buffId);<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ds_map_destroy(entry);<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ds_list_destroy(list)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ds_map_destroy(map)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br></p>
<br>
What we do here is first check the "id" key of the special
<tt>async_load</tt> map. If this value is the same as the value of
the original call-back function (stored in the "score_get"
variable) we then continue to process the data. The first thing we
do is parse the <tt>async_load</tt> ds_map for the key "entries"
which will contain a JSON object containing the leaderboard data.
This JSON object is then decoded (see <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/file%20handling/json_decode.html">
<tt>json_decode</tt></a>) as another ds_map, and this new map id is
stored in the variable "map".<br>
<br>
This map is checked for the key "default" and if that is found then
the map is destroyed and the event is exited. If no "default" key
is found, the code will then parse the map to extract the necessary
information about the leaderboard, by first extracting a ds_list
from the "entries" key of the ds_map, and then looping through each
entry of the list to get <i>another</i> ds_map with the name, score
and rank of each entry. These values are then stored in arrays and
then we check to see if there is an additional "data" key. If there
is (ie: the score was uploaded with an additional data package)
then we also parse that and send it to the compiler console for
debugging, before destroying the buffer and then continuing on to
destroy the map. Note that if the "data" key is included, it needs
to be decoded using the <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/buffers/buffer_base64_decode.html">
<tt>buffer_base64_decode()</tt></a> before it can be correctly
read.<br>
<br>
Once the loop has finished, the entries list is destroyed as is the
map that it was taken from. There is no need to destroy the
<tt>async_load</tt> ds_map as this is handled for you by
<i>GameMaker Studio 2</i>.</div>
