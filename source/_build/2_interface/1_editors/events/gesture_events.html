<h2>The Gesture Events</h2>

<div class="body-scroll">
<p><br>
</p>
<img class="center" src="images/editor_objects_gesture.png" alt=
"Object Editor Gesture Events">
<p>Events in the <b>Gesture Event</b> category will be triggered
whenever <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> detects a "gesture" of the mouse
or a touch screen event (while these gesture events are designed
specifically for mobile use, they can also be used on other targets
to detect the mouse, although they will not detect multiple touches
in this case). The goal of the gesture system is to try and
recognise inputs at a higher level than the direct mouse\touch
reading functions, and is designed to simplify the implementation
of commonly used inputs on touch-based devices.</p>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> These events will <b>not be
triggered on the HTML5</b> platform. If you are looking for
gestures on that target then you should be using the <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/controls/device%20input/index.html">
device functions</a>.</div>

<p><br>
You can choose to detect either <b>instance</b> gestures or
<b>global</b> gestures, where instance gesture events will only be
triggered when the initial touch/click is on an instance within the
room. Note that the instance <i>must</i> have a valid collision
mask (see <a href="../../1_editors/sprites.html">The Sprite Editor
- Collision Mask</a> and <a href="../../1_editors/objects.html">The
Object Editor - Collision Mask</a> sections for more details) for
this event to be triggered. Global events, however, will be
triggered by touching/clicking anywhere within the game room, and
for all instances that have the event.</p>

<p>When a gesture event is recognised, it will trigger one or more
of the available sub-events, and the sub-event triggered will
depend on the type of gesture that has been detected. In every
case, however, a <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/data_structures/ds%20maps/index.html">
DS Map</a> will be generated for you and stored in the built-in
variable <tt><b>event_data</b></tt>. The keys available will depend
on which kind of event it has been created by and are shown in each
of the sub-sections below.</p>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> The variable <tt>event_data</tt> is
<b>only valid in these events</b>, as the <tt>ds_map</tt> that it
points to is automatically created at the start of the event, then
destroyed again at the end, with this variable being reset to a
value of -1 at all other times.</div>

<p><br>
It is worth noting that if you have multiple instances under the
position being touched and they all have a gesture event, then all
of them will trigger, not just the "topmost" instance. Also note
that when using multiple views and dragging an instance, the values
returned will be based on the view you were in when the initial
touch/click was received - this is true for all subsequent events
in that gesture for that instance. So touching and dragging an
instance in one view then releasing the touch in another view, will
return values relative to the initial view where the gesture was
first detected.</p>

<label class="collapse" for="a">Tap</label> <input id="a" type=
"checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>The <b>Tap</b> event will be triggered when an instance has been
touched or clicked or - if it is a global event - when the game
registers a touch or click anywhere in the room. A tap is
considered a quick touch and release, and if the touch lasts too
long then it will be considered a Drag (and trigger the Drag
gesture events instead of the Tap event). This event will generate
an <tt>event_data</tt> DS map which you can then use to get
information about the event. For example:</p>

<h3>Create Event</h3>

<p class="code">x_goto = x;<br>
y_goto = y;<br></p>

<h3>Tap Event</h3>

<p class="code">x_goto = event_data[? "posX"];<br>
y_goto = event_data[? "posY"];<br></p>

<h3>Step Event</h3>

<p class="code">var _pd = point_distance(x, y, x_goto, y_goto);<br>
move_towards_point(x_goto, y_goto, clamp(_pd, 0, 5);<br></p>

<p><br>
The above code will detect a tap on the screen and then get the
position of the tap to move the instance to that position. Note
that if you want to have a longer or shorter tap detection time
then you can set it with the function <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/controls/gesture%20input/gesture_drag_time.html">
<tt>gesture_drag_time</tt></a>. This sets the time between the
initial detection and the tap becoming a drag, so set it to a
higher value to make tap detection longer or a lower value to make
it shorter (value is in seconds and defaults to 0.16).</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="gesture_double_tap" id="gesture_double_tap"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="b">Double Tap</label> <input id="b"
type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>The <b>Double Tap</b> event will be triggered when an instance
has been touched or clicked twice in quick succession (or - if it
is a global event - when the game registers two quick touches or
clicks anywhere in the room). A double tap is considered two quick
touches and releases, but if any of the touches lasts too long then
it will be considered a Drag (and trigger the Drag gesture events
instead of the Double Tap event). This event will generate an
<tt>event_data</tt> DS map which you can then use to get
information about the event. For example:</p>

<h3>Create Event</h3>

<p class="code">x_goto = x;<br>
y_goto = y;<br></p>

<h3>Double Tap Event</h3>

<p class="code">instance_destroy();<br></p>

<p><br>
The above code simply detects a double tap and then destroys the
instance. Note that you can set the time between taps to trigger a
double tap using the function <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/controls/gesture%20input/gesture_double_tap_time.html">
<tt>gesture_double_tap_time</tt></a> (which has a default value -
in seconds - of 0.16) and you can also set the distance for
detection between taps with the function <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/controls/gesture%20input/gesture_double_tap_distance.html">
<tt>gesture_double_tap_distance</tt></a> (if a second tap is
detected outside of this distance it will be considered a regular
tap event).</p>
</div>

<a name="gesture_drag_start" id="gesture_drag_start"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="c">Drag Start</label> <input id="c"
type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>The <b>Drag Start</b> event will be triggered when the user
maintains a touch or click without releasing it. It will be
triggered once when a set time has passed after the initial touch,
which is 0.16 seconds by default (although you can set this to any
other value in seconds using the function <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/controls/gesture%20input/gesture_drag_time.html">
<tt>gesture_drag_time</tt></a>). After this event has been
triggered, and as long as the user has a touch/click held down,
then the <b>Dragging</b> event will be triggered every step until
the touch/click has been released. This event will generate an
<tt>event_data</tt> DS map which you can then use to get
information about the event. For example:</p>

<h3>Create Event</h3>

<p class="code">drag_offsetX = 0;<br>
drag_offsetY = 0;<br></p>

<h3>Drag Start Event</h3>

<p class="code">drag_offsetX = x - event_data[?"posX"];<br>
drag_offsetY = y - event_data[?"posY"];<br></p>

<p><br>
The above code uses the Drag Start event to get the position of the
touch/click and use it to set an offset value for the x and y axis.
This can then be used when dragging the instance to ensure that it
doesn't "jump" to the position that the touch/click was detected at
(see the <b>Dragging</b> event below for a continuation of this
example).</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="gesture_dragging" id="gesture_dragging"></a> <label class=
"collapse" for="d">Dragging</label> <input id="d" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>The <b>Dragging</b> event is triggered after the <b>Drag
Start</b> event, and will be triggered for every step that the user
maintains the touch/click on the instance (or the screen, if it's a
global event) and moves more than the defined dragging threshold.
This distance is 0.1 inches by default but can be set using the
function <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/controls/gesture%20input/gesture_drag_distance.html">
<tt>gesture_drag_distance</tt></a>. If there is no movement or the
movement is under the defined threshold, the event will not be
triggered. This event will generate an <tt>event_data</tt> DS map
which you can then use to get information about the event. For
example:</p>

<h3>Create Event</h3>

<p class="code">drag_offsetX = 0;<br>
drag_offsetY = 0;<br></p>

<h3>Drag Start Event</h3>

<p class="code">drag_offsetX = x - event_data[?"posX"];<br>
drag_offsetY = y - event_data[?"posY"];<br></p>

<h3>Dragging Event</h3>

<p class="code">x = event_data[?"posX"] + drag_offsetX;<br>
y = event_data[?"posY"] + drag_offsetY;<br></p>

<p><br>
The example code above uses the offset variables set in the <b>Drag
Start</b> event to move the instance when the <b>Dragging</b> event
is triggered.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="gesture_drag_end" id="gesture_drag_end"></a> <label class=
"collapse" for="e">Drag End</label> <input id="e" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>The <b>Drag End</b> event is triggered when the user releases
the touch/click on the instance (or the screen if the event is
global). This event will generate an <tt>event_data</tt> DS map
which you can then use to get information about the event, but in
this event the map will have an extra key: "<tt>isflick</tt>".
Flick is calculated as the <i>distance per second</i> that the drag
has occurred over, and the value for the "<tt>isflick</tt>" key
will be <tt>true</tt> if it is greater than the defined distance
per second value, or <tt>false</tt> otherwise. Note that the
default is 2 inches per second, but you can set it to another value
using the function <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/controls/gesture%20input/gesture_flick_speed.html">
<tt>gesture_flick_speed</tt></a>. Also note that there is a
dedicated <b>Flick</b> event which will also be triggered if the
"<tt>isflick</tt>" variable is <tt>true</tt>. An example of use
would be:</p>

<h3>Create Event</h3>

<p class="code">flickVelX = 0.0;<br>
flickVelY = 0.0;<br></p>

<h3>Drag End Event</h3>

<p class="code">isFlick = event_data[?"isflick"];<br>
if (isFlick)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flickVelX = event_data[?"diffX"];<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flickVelY = event_data[?"diffY"];<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flickVelX = 0;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flickVelY = 0;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br></p>

<h3>Step Event</h3>

<p class="code">x += flickVelX;<br>
y += flickVelY;<br>
flickVelX *= 0.7;<br>
flickVelY *= 0.7;<br></p>

<p><br>
The above code simply gets the difference in x and y position of
the last <b>Dragging</b> event and the current <b>Drag End</b>
event, and if the movement has been greater than the flick
threshold, it sets some variables that are use to the move the
instance in the step event.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="gesture_flick" id="gesture_flick"></a> <label class=
"collapse" for="f">Flick</label> <input id="f" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>The <b>Flick</b> event is only triggered when a touch/click has
been held, dragged and then released and the distance between the
last drag position and the release position is greater than 2

be changed using the function <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/controls/gesture%20input/gesture_flick_speed.html">
<tt>gesture_flick_speed</tt></a>). This event will generate an
<tt>event_data</tt> DS map which you can then use to get

<p><br>
The above code simply gets the difference in x and y position of

<p>The "Pinch" events are based on two touches to the devices

<p>The <b>Pinch Start</b> event will be triggered when an instance
(or the screen if the event is global) has been touched by two
"fingers" (and the touch is maintained) and then one or both of the
"fingers" is moved. If the touches move away from each other or
towards each other more than the minimum check distance (which is
0.1 inches by default, but it can be set using the function
<a href="../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/controls/gesture%20input/gesture_pinch_distance.html">
<tt>gesture_pinch_distance</tt></a>), and the angle between them is
within the defined value (this defaults to 45° but can be set using
<a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/controls/gesture%20input/gesture_pinch_angle_towards.html">

"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/controls/gesture%20input/gesture_pinch_angle_away.html">
<tt>- gesture_pinch_angle_away()</tt></a>), then a <b>Pinch

variables or store position date for future use. For example:</p>

<h3>Pinch Start Event</h3>

<p class="code">pinching = true;<br>

<p>The "Rotate" events are based on two touches to the devices

The angle of movement of the touches along with the movement of

Rotate event, where (in the case of the <b>Rotate Event</b>
type):</p>

<ul>
<li>Two touches must be held down for a specified minimum time (the

<li>Within this minimum time period they must rotate in a

<p>The <b>Rotate Start</b> event will be triggered when an instance

<h3>Rotate Start Event</h3>

<p class="code">rotating = true;<br></p>
