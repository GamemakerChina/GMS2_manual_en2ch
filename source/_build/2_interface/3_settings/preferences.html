<h2>Platform Specific Preferences</h2>

<div class="body-scroll">
<p>This section of the manual covers the different <b>Platform
Specific Preferences</b> that need to be set up before you can
compile your games to certain targets. These generally only need
set up once to start with (although future updates to the <a href=
"../../1_overview/1_getting_started/3_updating.html">runtimes</a>
may require you to change certain things, but these will be
mentioned in the <a href=
"../../1_overview/1_getting_started/4_release_notes.html">Release
Notes</a>) and are use to point to any SDKs that are required and
set basic options for how you want <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> to
compile your game projects for any given platform. Note that the
platforms available will depend on the <a href=
"../../1_overview/1_getting_started/6_licensing.html">Licence</a>
that you have and not all of them may be available.</p>

<p>Below is a list of all the available target platforms and their
preferences:</p>

<blockquote><label class="collapse" for="g">Amazon Fire</label>
<input id="g" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>The <b>Amazon Fire</b> preferences are split into various
sections listed below. A number of these refer to Android tools,
since the AMazon Fire target is based off of Android and share the
same SDK requirements. <img class="center" src=
"images/amazonfire_prefs_1.png" alt=
"Amazon Fire Preferences Packaging And Debug"></p>

<p>At the top of the preferences you have the option to synchronise
the settings from the Android export. This is for those people that
have the Mobile Licence and have already set up and used the
Android export, since Amazon Fire uses almost the exact same build
tools as Android. Just click this to import all the appropriate
settings from Android, then check through them to make sure that
they are correct.</p>

<p>Under the Synch button you can set the size of the Memory Heap
for the Android JDK. Next you have to set up the various different
<b>Paths</b> so that <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> knows where to look
for the various tools required to build the final executable
package and test your game. This is split into three sections for
the <b>Android SDK</b>, <b>Android NDK</b> and <b>Java JDK</b>.
These paths should have been filled in automatically for you, but
should you have any issues you can click the button to the right to
open the file explorer and manually select the locations for each
element. You can find details of what versions are required for
each of the SDK elements <a href=
"http://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/227860547" target=
"_blank">here</a>. Paths should be validated as you apply them and
a message will show "Found" or tell you of any errors (in which
case you should revise all the information to make sure it is
correct).</p>

<p>Below that you have the different <b>Packaging</b> options which
are:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Always do full install of APK</b>: Flagging this will make
<i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> remove any previous runners of your game
from your device, as well as all associated files (for example,
*.ini files) from your test device before installing a new version
of the game.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Install on package</b>: When this option is flagged,
compiling a final executable <tt>*.apk</tt> package will also
install it automatically on the currently selected target
device.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally we come to the <b>KeyStore</b>. This is a file that will
be used to "sign" all your Amazon Fire apps so please fill in all
the details correctly and keep in mind that this file will be
required to create and update all your Amazon Fire apps in the
future, meaning that after setting it up <i><b>it is advised to
take a screenshot of the settings used and make a backup of the
final file</b></i>. If you lose this file you will <i>not</i> be
able to update any existing games that have been uploaded to the
Google Play store.</p>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: The same keystore can be used for
both the Android and Amazon Fire targets.</div>

<p><br>
To create a new keystore file the following details are required:
<img class="center" src="images/amazonfire_prefs_2.png" alt=
"Amazon Fire Preferences Keystore"></p>

<ul>
<li><b>Filename</b>: This is the name of the KeyStore file.
<b>NOTE</b>: <i>This is not your name or the company name, but the
name of the file to be generated!</i> If you already have a
keystore file from previous projects then you can click the file
browser button here and direct <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> to the old
keystore file (or click the <i>Import</i> button). In this case,
you must still fill out the rest of the required information (as it
was when you <i>first</i> generated the file) but you <b>must not
click the <i>Generate Key Hash</i> button!</b>. That will generate
a <i>new</i> keystore file, overwriting the previous one.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Common Name</b>: This would normally be your name.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Password</b>: Your security password for the KeyStore file
which must be at least six characters long.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Alias</b>: This is another name that can be used for the
KeyStore file and should be different to the name entered
above.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Alias Password</b>: Your alias security password for the
KeyStore file which must be at least six characters long.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Organisational Unit</b>: The department within the company
that you are a part of.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Organisation</b>: The name of your company.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Location</b>: The name of the town or city where you are
based.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Country</b>: The standard two letter code for the country
where you are based.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once this information is filled in and you are happy with it,
press the button marked <i>Generate Key Hash</i> for <i>GameMaker
Studio 2</i> to create the necessary KeyStore file. This may take a
moment but once it is finished, it normally will not need to be
changed again. Note that you can click the <i>Import</i> button to
import a previously created keystore file (see the <b>Filename</b>
section, above) and you can also retrieve the keystore SHA1 hash by
clicking the <i>Show Key Hash</i> button. Pressing this will
generate two special security hash keys directly linked to your
keystore file that some web sites require for correct functionality
(for example, Facebook, or Google Play for the Sha1 hash). Should
you need this, simply press the button, then copy and paste the
hash keys that are generated.</p>

SDKs, please see <a href=

choose between <i>Package as loose files</i> - which will simply
generate all the required files in a folder - or <i>Package as
