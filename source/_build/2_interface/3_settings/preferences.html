<h2>Platform Specific Preferences</h2>

<div class="body-scroll">
<p>This section of the manual covers the different <b>Platform
Specific Preferences</b> that need to be set up before you can
compile your games to certain targets. These generally only need
set up once to start with (although future updates to the <a href=
"../../1_overview/1_getting_started/3_updating.html">runtimes</a>
may require you to change certain things, but these will be
mentioned in the <a href=
"../../1_overview/1_getting_started/4_release_notes.html">Release
Notes</a>) and are use to point to any SDKs that are required and
set basic options for how you want <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> to
compile your game projects for any given platform. Note that the
platforms available will depend on the <a href=
"../../1_overview/1_getting_started/6_licensing.html">Licence</a>
that you have and not all of them may be available.</p>

<p>Below is a list of all the available target platforms and their
preferences:</p>

<blockquote><label class="collapse" for="a">Android</label>
<input id="a" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>The <b>Android</b> preferences are split into various sections
listed below. <img class="center" src="images/android_prefs_1.png"
alt="Android Preferences Packaging And Debug"></p>

<p>At the top of the preferences you can set the size of the Memory
Heap for the Android JDK. Below that you have the different
<b>Packaging</b> options which are:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Always do full install of APK</b>: Flagging this will make
<i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> remove any previous runners of your game
from your device, as well as all associated files (for example,
*.ini files) from your test device before installing a new version
of the game.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Install on package</b>: When this option is flagged,
compiling a final executable <tt>*.apk</tt> package will also
install it automatically on any devices that are connected.</li>
</ul>

<p>Next you have to set up the various different <b>Paths</b> so
that <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> knows where to look for the various
tools required to build the final executable package and test your
game. This is split into three sections for the <b>Android SDK</b>,
<b>Android NDK</b> and <b>Java JDK</b>. These paths should have
been filled in automatically for you, but should you have any
issues you can click the button to the right to open the file
explorer and manually select the locations for each element. You
can find details of what versions are required for each of the SDK
elements <a href=
"http://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/216753748-SDK-Version-Support"
target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>You should click the buttons marked <i>Check Android SDK</i> and
<i>Check Android NDK</i> after setting the paths, as this will then
validate all the information and tell you of any errors (in which
case you should revise all the information to make sure it is
correct). When everything checks out you should receive the message
"<i>Android SDK/NDK Valid</i>". <img class="center" src=
"images/android_prefs_3.png" alt=
"Android Preferences Keystore"></p>

<p>The <b>KeyStore</b> is a file that will be used to "sign" all
your Android apps so please fill in all the details correctly and
keep in mind that this file will be required to create and update
all your Android apps in the future, meaning that after setting it
up <i><b>it is advised to take a screenshot of the settings used
and make a backup of the final file</b></i>. If you lose this file
you will <i>not</i> be able to update any existing games that have
been uploaded to the Google Play store.</p>

<p>To create a new keystore file the following details are
required:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Filename</b>: This is the name of the KeyStore file.
<b>NOTE</b>: <i>This is not your name or the company name, but the
name of the file to be generated!</i> If you already have a
keystore file from previous projects then you can click the file
browser button here and direct <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> to the old
keystore file (or click the <i>Import</i> button). In this case,
you must still fill out the rest of the required information (as it
was when you <i>first</i> generated the file) but you <b>must not
click the <i>Generate Key Hash</i> button!</b>. That will generate
a <i>new</i> keystore file, overwriting the previous one.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Common Name</b>: This would normally be your name.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Password</b>: Your security password for the KeyStore file
which must be at least six characters long.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Alias</b>: This is another name that can be used for the
KeyStore file and should be different to the name entered
above.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Organisational Unit</b>: The department within the company
that you are a part of.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Organisation</b>: The name of your company.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Location</b>: The name of the town or city where you are
based.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Country</b>: The standard two letter code for the country
where you are based.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once this information is filled in and you are happy with it,
press the button marked <i>Generate Key Hash</i> for <i>GameMaker
Studio 2</i> to create the necessary KeyStore file. This may take a
moment but once it is finished, it normally will not need to be
changed again. Note that you can click the <i>Import</i> button to
import a previously created keystore file (see the <b>Filename</b>
section, above) and you can also retrieve the keystore SHA1 hash by
clicking the <i>Show Key Hash</i> button. Pressing this will
generate two special security hash keys directly linked to your
keystore file that some web sites require for correct functionality
(for example, Facebook, or Google Play for the Sha1 hash). Should
you need this, simply press the button, then copy and paste the
hash keys that are generated.</p>

<p>The <b>iOS</b> preferences have the following options:

<ul>
<li><b>Suppress build and run</b>: By default when you create an
iOS project and then build a final executable package, <i>GameMaker
Studio 2</i> will build the package and then attempt to run it on
any connected devices. Checking this option will suppress building
the app and running it on the device and simply create an XCode
project on the host Mac<br>

<p>The Steam SDK is used for Windows, Mac OS and Ubuntu (Linux)
builds that are to be distributed through the <a target=

options required to get it working within your projects:
<img class="center" src="images/steam_prefs.png" alt=

<ul>
<li><b>Path To Steam SDK</b>: The system path to where you have
installed the Steam SDK. Once you have set this path to the SDK,
you will then need to activate Steam in the <a href=

<ul>
<li><b>Visual Studio Path</b>: This option is for pointing
<i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> to the MS Visual Studio installation on
the build PC.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Default Packaging Type</b>: When building a final Windows
executable package, you can choose between creating either an
<i>installer</i> (using <a href=
"https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/" target="_blank">NSIS</a>)
or a compressed ZIP file that will have the game and any additional
files within. By default you will be given a choice of which of
these two options you wish to choose on compile, but you can set
this preference to always use one or the other. Note that when this
option is set to <i>Show Dialogue</i>, in the actual dialogue
window that pops up on compile, choosing "Remember Packaging
Option" will set this preference to the option you select.<br>
<br></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Note that apart from setting up these preferences, you will also
need to set up the devices that some of these platforms target,
otherwise you may not be able to compile nor test your projects.
