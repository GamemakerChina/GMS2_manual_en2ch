<h2>Bitwise Operators And Binary</h2>

<div class="body-scroll">
<p><br>
</p>

<p>At the beginning of the computer era, binary and hex
(hexadecimal) were a way of life, probably because high level
languages (such as BASIC) were simply too slow. These days however,
with the power of even the most average PC, you no longer have to
know any of this and you can do things the long way, since the
speed of the machine and its more complex CPU construction will
make up for any short comings this approach has.</p>

<p>As a very simple example, in the past multiplying by 32 might
have taken several CPU cycles to execute, while a simple binary
operation to do the same thing would have taken only 1. As machines
have gotten more complex, they have also reduced the time many
complex instructions take to run so that now, a 32x32 bit multiply
might well only take 1 cycle - same as the binary operator. This is
great news of course, since it means that you no longer have to
optimise every line of code you write, but if this is the case -
should you really care about binary at all?</p>

<p>The answer is definitely "yes, you should". While it's true you
can still get some speed ups - and sometimes these can be
significant - using binary and hex leads to you knowing the CPU
better and can also lead to writing better code, being able to pack
data better, and making some tasks a lot simpler. This page is
going to explain a bit about what binary is as well as how it can
be used when making your games.</p>

<blockquote><label class="collapse" for="one">Number Theory</label>
<input id="one" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">So let's look at the most basic binary
theory first - how numbers are created. Take a look at this
table:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">000 = 0<br>
001 = 1<br>
010 = 2<br>
100 = 4<br></p>
<br>
Each 1 or 0 represents a single <i>bit</i> of data, and as you can
see this means that in binary, 10 equals 2! Each bit is <i>2 times
the previous value</i> with the first bit being equal to 1. So bit
2 = 2, bit 3 = 4, bit 4 = 8 and so on (as shown below in this
<i>byte</i> table - a byte being a collection of 8 bits):<br>
<br>

<p class="code">00000001 = 1<br>
00000010 = 2<br>
00000100 = 4<br>
00001000 = 8<br>
00010000 = 16<br>
00100000 = 32<br>
01000000 = 64<br>
10000000 = 128<br></p>
<br>
That's fine if you want numbers that are a power of 2, but how do
we create more complex numbers? Well a single binary number can
only store a 0 or 1, and that's it, so for more complex numbers we
need to add bits together. If for example we wanted to make 6, we
would add 4 and 2 together like so.<br>
<br>

<p class="code">00000010 = 2<br>
00000100 = 4<br>
00000110 = 6<br></p>
<br>
This is true of <i>all</i> binary numbers, and how the computer
makes up any number internally. Let's take a slightly more
complicated number as a further example: 23. The number 23 is
actually made up of 1+2+4+16 or 00010111. How about a much more
complex example: 196? Well, that's made from 128+64+4 or 11000100.
So actually not that complex really. If we start doing values
outside of the range of a byte (which can store numbers from 0 to
255), it does start to get a little harder to track. For example,
217,361 is 110101000100010001 in binary. Or, 1+16+256+etc... The
rules are the same no matter what the value being expressed is -
each number is created from adding multiple bits together.</div>
<br>
<label class="collapse" for="two">Binary Operators</label>
<input id="two" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">Now what does this mean in binary? Well,
let's say you want to store a <tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt> as a
value. Usually compilers will use an INT (an INT is usually defined
as a signed 32bit number) and then simply assign it to 0 or 1.
However, having only 2 states, a <tt>true</tt> / <tt>false</tt>
value is ideal to store in a bit, and if we did this we could store
32 <tt>true</tt> / <tt>false</tt> bits for each INT rather than
just one.<br>
<br>
How would we do this? Well pretty easily it turns out:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">flags = flags | 1;<br></p>
<br>
The "|" operator is a <b>bitwise OR</b>, and this means the above
instruction ORs 1 into flags. If you remember from earlier, using a
1 will set the first bit. If we wanted to set the second bit, we
would do this:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">flags = flags | 2;<br></p>
<br>
We OR in 2, because the bit pattern 00000010 is equal to 2. So what
exactly does the binary OR operator do? Well, it merges all the
bits together into a single value, like this:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">010110100<br>
110011001<br>
110111101<br></p>

<p><br>
Here's what's known as a <i>truth table</i> for the OR
operator:<br>
<br></p>

<p class="code">00 | 00 = 00<br>
00 | 01 = 01<br>
01 | 01 = 01<br>
01 | 00 = 01<br></p>
<br>
So where there is a value with 2 zeros, it'll stay zero. The
advantage of using BITS as a true/false state, is they you can set
several flags in one operation, something you simply couldn't do
with a normal Boolean value. For example, let's say bit 1 is an
"active" flag, and bit 3 is a "visible" flag. We could set
<i>both</i> by doing this:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">flags = flags | 5;<br></p>
<br>
This is because 5 is 00000101 in binary, and following the rule
above, the variable "flags" will get both these 2 bits merged with
its own. So even if bit 1 was already set, the operation still
works and bit 3 will now also be set.<br>
<br>
What about clearing flags? Well this is where the binary AND
operation comes in. When you AND something you the bits that are
set in the mask are kept, while the bits that are clear in the
mask, are removed - like this:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">01110010101<br>
00110000100<br>
00110000100<br></p>
<br>
As you can see, where there is a bit in each value, the bit is
kept, and where there is a mix or 0's and 1's these are reset to 0.
Here's the truth table for ANDing:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">00 &amp; 00 = 00<br>
01 &amp; 00 = 00<br>
00 &amp; 01 = 00<br>
01 &amp; 01 = 01<br></p>

<p><br>
So, only when there is a bit in each place will it be kept. What
this means, is that just as you are able to <i>set</i> multiple
flags at once, you can also <i>clear</i> multiple flags at once.
For example, let's take the case above, but this time clear them.
We want to clear bits 1 and 3 (giving us the value 5), but in
remembering the truth table above, what we want to do is keep all
the other bits, and clear bits 1 and 3. This would be a binary
"mask" of 11111111111111111111111111111010 (32bits). This mask
keeps all bits currently set, but clears the two bits we actually
want cleared. So if had a value of 1000111011 and I wanted to clear
bits 1 and 3 using the mask above, I would end up with this...<br>
<br></p>

<p class="code">00000000000000000000001000111011<br>
11111111111111111111111111111010<br>
00000000000000000000001000111010<br></p>
<br>
This is great, but if we had to work this out every time we needed
to clear flags, it would become tiresome. What we need is a way to
flip bits easily (and preferably without CPU cost). Fortunately
there is an easy way of doing this by using the NOT operator.<br>
<br>
The NOT operator is just what it says - NOT those bits. Here's a
truth table for NOT.<br>
<br>

<p class="code">~00 = 11<br>
~01 = 10<br>
~10 = 01<br>
~11 = 00<br></p>
<br>
This operator makes removing flags very simple, and better yet,
it's usually a compile time optimisation meaning if you're using a
constant number (i.e. not a variable) then the compiler will flip
the bits automatically for you. Take this statement where we want
to clear bits 1 and 3 again:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">a = a &amp; ~5;<br></p>
<br>
This will actually compile down to just "a &amp;
11111111111111111111111111111010". This makes life pretty simple in
terms of clearing flags.<br>
<br>
The last operator we want to look at is EOR (Exclusive OR,
sometimes called XOR), this operator flips the bits set in
<i>both</i> values. Here's the EOR truth table:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">0 ^ 0 = 0<br>
0 ^ 1 = 1<br>
1 ^ 0 = 1<br>
1 ^ 1 = 0<br></p>
<br>
This is a curious one, but incredibly useful. For example, let's
say we want a counter that simply counts from 0 to 1 and back to 0
(toggling between 0 and 1), we could add one and do an IF to see if
it's gotten to 2, and then reset it back to 1. Or...we could add 1
and then AND it with 1 (since 01+01 = 10, and 10 &amp; 01 = 0) or
we can do this:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">a = a ^ 1;<br></p>
<br>
What this does, is first time through is 0 ^ 1 = 1, then the second
time 1 ^ 1 = 0, thereby toggling things back and forth from 0 to
1.<br>
<br>
So - OR (|), AND(&amp;), NOT(~) and EOR(^) let us manipulate bits
with relative ease, allowing us, at the simplest level, to control
multiple bits at once. We can obviously use these operations for
other things when developing our games, like masking sprites, doing
integer MOD operations (using AND) or doing nice looping
counters.</div>
<br>
<label class="collapse" for="three">Simple Binary
Arithmetic</label> <input id="three" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">How does a computer add? Well let's look at
a very simple example 1+1.<br>
<br>

<p class="code">00000001<br>
00000001<br>
00000010<br></p>
<br>
Just like normal additions, we add numbers together and then we
overflow into the next column, but unlike a normal decimal
addition, we can only go to 1, not 9. So adding a 1+1 means we
overflow into 10. So let's look at a more complex example.<br>
<br>

<p class="code">01011011 = 91<br>
00101101 = 45<br>
10001000 = 136<br></p>
<br>
It's obviously harder to see here, but the overflows ripple along
until there are no ones in a column - or 2 at which point an
overflow bit makes 3 and it stays there. Fortunately, you don't
ever have to worry about this unless you want to add very large
numbers together (like 2x128bit numbers). It’s also worth noting,
that computers can only add (or subtract, multiply or divide) 2
numbers at once, even SIMD is based on 2 calculations at once, but
doing multiple calculations in parallel. Take 19 + 19 + 19. Being
human, we can add all the 9's together, carry the 2 and then on we
go! But computers can't do that - what they <i>can</i> do is this:
(19 + 19) + 19. So they'll do each calculation in blocks of 2.<br>
<br>
The binary calculations that are of interest to us, and of great
use, are multiplication and division. Computers only multiply in
2s, and to do more it'll break a number apart, and then add all the
results together. Let's take some very simple examples first. 4 * 2
= 8. Now to multiply by 2 in binary, we shift all the bits to the
LEFT by one. Like this:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">00000100 * 2 = 00001000 = 8</p>
<br>
All the bits in this case have moved to the left by one, making it
move from the 3rd bit, to the 4th, and changing the value from 4 to
8. How about a larger number?<br>
<br>

<p class="code">101 = 01100101 * 2 = 11001010 = 202</p>
<br>
Again, all the bits move on one, and that multiples by 2. So, how
about a multiple by 4? Easy, we shift everything left by 2, rather
than one. So how about 16, or 128? This would require a left shift
of 4 bits, or 7 bits respectively. This is incredibly useful; it
means we can do simple multiplications by simply moving bits
around. To do this, we use the SHIFT operator &lt;&lt;. Here are
some examples:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">00000001 &lt;&lt; 1 = 000000010 = 2<br>
00000001 &lt;&lt; 2 = 000000100 = 4<br>
00000001 &lt;&lt; 3 = 000001000 = 8<br>
00000001 &lt;&lt; 4 = 000010000 = 16<br>
00000001 &lt;&lt; 5 = 000100000 = 32<br>
00000001 &lt;&lt; 6 = 001000000 = 64<br>
00000001 &lt;&lt; 7 = 010000000 = 128<br>
00000001 &lt;&lt; 8 = 100000000 = 256<br></p>
<br>
Now, aside from being very useful for fast/simple multiplications,
it's also very useful for setting specific BITs, without having to
figure out the bit value. Let's say we wanted to set bit 27, what
number is that? (67108864 by the way!), well we can use the syntax
above to easily set flags like this:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">A = A | (1&lt;&lt;27)<br></p>
<br>
Okay... so actually this would be bit 26 the way I've been
describing things so far (as bits have been starting at one), but
actually... bits start at bit 0, and go upwards, not at bit 1. So
while there are 32 bits in an INTEGER, the bits range from 0 to 31,
not 1 to 32. This is actually pretty useful, as we can now set up
CONSTANTS for bit numbers.<br>
<br>
So let's say Bit 27 is an active flag, and bit 0 is an exploding
flag. How can we set both?<br>
<br>

<p class="code">ACTIVE= 27;<br>
BOOM = 0;<br>
A = A | (1&lt;&lt;ACTIVE) | (1&lt;&lt;BOOM);<br></p>
<br>
This may look like a lot of code, but if these numbers are
constants, the compiler will pre-compile these operations into a
single value so that we end up with this as actual code.<br>
<br>

<p class="code">A = A | 13421772;<br></p>
<br>
Clearing these bits (as we saw above) is simply a matter of using
the NOT modifier, like this:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">A = A &amp; ~((1&lt;&lt;ACTIVE) |
(1&lt;&lt;BOOM));<br></p>
<br>
So this happily lets us set and clear any bits we'd like, and it
also lets us compress out data structures massively. Compressing
data structures is a good thing, because if you use less memory,
you get less cache misses, and your code just runs faster. Put it
this way, what's quicker, copying 32Mbytes or data, or 4Mbytes?
Well, quite clearly 4 is. So if you can pack all yours flags down
into a single memory access, this is good!</div>
<br>
<label class="collapse" for="four">Binary Division</label>
<input id="four" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">Let's take a quick look at how you do
division, and why it's going to be so useful. Let's take a simple
number - 64 - and divide by 32:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">64 / 32 = 01000000 &gt;&gt; 5 = 00000010<br></p>
<br>
So there you shift the single bit <i>down</i> by 5 (which is the
number of shifts required for 32 – look above), which gives us 2.
But what happens if here are other bits in there? Well let's take a
look:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">68 / 32 = 01000100 &gt;&gt; 5 = 00000010<br></p>
<br>
So there you go…. It's exactly the same. The bits we shift down are
simply lost. This is actually really useful, because when dividing
down if we need the remainder, there's an even easier way to get
it, which we'll get to in a moment. But first, let's take a
practical example. I have an X and Y position, and I want to get
the grid cell this falls in, where the grid is 32x32 in size. This
method allows is to store objects, collisions, flags – all manner
of things, and access them very quickly. So here we go:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">var X_index = x&gt;&gt;5;<br>
var Y_index = y&gt;&gt;5;<br>
cell_data = mygrid[# X_index,Y_index];<br></p>
<br>
This is quick, very quick. This avoids the need to do a floating
point divide, and then a floor( ) calculation – which all adds
up.<br>
<br>
So, what if we wanted the remainder? Perhaps this remainder is used
as some kind of order or something, whatever the reason, getting a
remainder is as simple as doing an AND:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">var r = x &amp; 31<br>
var X_Index = x&gt;&gt;5;<br></p>
<br>
Now, the sharp-sighted amongst you might have noticed we've used
both here (as is so often the case), but this is still only a
couple of instructions. But why the 31? Well, as bit 5 is 32, then
all the bits below would be 31, and that's the maximum remainder so
that's what we AND with (we could also use ((1&lt;&lt;5)-1) which
would make 32-1 = 31. Now, if I were to do this without
understanding binary, it would look like this:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">var r = x mod 32;<br>
var X_Index = floor(x/32);<br></p>
<br>
So why is this much worse? Well, in order to divide by 32, we have
to execute a floating point divide – which obviously takes time,
but in order to do the mod 32, you actually have to do another one!
If we were doing this in assembler, we actually get BOTH values in
one divide, but you don't get this in high level languages (well…
not very often), and so you have to do all the work twice. This
adds up, especially if you're doing a tight loop with lots of
calculations like this. Integer divides as shown above really help
optimising your game.</div></blockquote>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p><br>
</p>

<p>Since this can be quite a complex concept to grasp and then
apply to real-world programming situations, you can find below a
series of short examples that could be applied to any game made
with <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i>.</p>

<blockquote><label class="collapse" for="five">Tile
Alignment</label> <input id="five" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list"><i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> devs often use
the function <tt>place_free()</tt>, and then when a collision is
found, try to slowly move the object out by either looping around
an x or y position (or something) while continuing to execute that
function, or by using the <tt>move_outside_all()</tt> function.<br>
<br>
So, what's the faster way to do this? Well, if we use proper
power-of-2 tiles, then we have a very simple method that's also
lightning fast. If we are moving right, and we've moved into a
collision block, then as we know everything is aligned to 32, so we
need to also align the sprite to a 32 pixel boundary - preferably
the one to the left - so the sprite is moved OUT of the collision.
This is really easy, knowing the rules we've used above to get the
remainder, and knowing how to get the inverse of bits, we can
simply do this:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">x = x&amp;~31;<br></p>
<br>
That's right, that's ALL that it takes to align to a 32 pixel
boundary. By changing the 31 we can align to anything we like – as
long as it's a power of 2. (This is the equivalent of dividing by
32, then multiplying by 32, thereby removing the lower bits.)<br>
<br>
If we wanted to align to the right, then we'd do the above, but
then add 32 to move it into the next tile. Simple. All this makes
the whole collision code monumentally faster, and lets you spend
the CPU time where you really need it.</div>
<br>
<label class="collapse" for="six">Keys And Doors</label> <input id=
"six" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">Say you have a level with a few doors, and
a key for each. How can you easily mark a key for a key? Well,
normally you'd just assign an ID to the key and the door. So what
if you wanted a key to open 2 or 3 doors? Easy. You use a MASK. The
door would have a single "bit" assigned like so door_id=1 (0001),
another with door_id=2 (0010), door_id=4 (0100),door_id=8 (1000)
and so on. If we wanted the key to open door 1 and 3, then the key
would have the MASK of 5 (which is 101 in binary). If we perform an
AND of this, and it comes out "not zero", then we know if the key
can open the door. You could also have keys that opened nothing by
having a MASK of 0. See the code below for the actual check:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">if( (key_id &amp; door_id) !=0 ) { opendoor();

<label class="collapse" for="seven">Looping Counters</label>
<input id="seven" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">Let's say we want a simple animation
counter, counting from 0 to to 15 (as we have 16 frames of
animation), now we can either do an increment, and then do an IF,
or we can use our knowledge of binary and remove the IF completely.
IF's are slow, and if we don't need them, we should remove
them.<br>
<br>

<p class="code">counter = (counter+1)&amp;15;<br></p>
<br>
Since 16 frames is a power of 2 number, and since 0 is included in
the counter, we can reduce the POW2 number by 1 and use it as a
MASK, and using that we can use it to wrap our counter. If the
counter moves from 15 to 16, we end up with bit pattern 10000, and
if we then AND with 15 (bit pattern 01111) we end up with 0. This
means the above code is incredibly useful for wrapping counters -
as long as you use POW2 frame numbers.</div>

something was a power of 2? Well, here's a neat little trick.. This
will return TRUE if argument0 is a power of 2.<br>
<br>

<p class="code">return (argument0&amp;(argument0-1))==0;<br></p>
<br>
So if we had the number 51 (110011) what does this do? Well, we get
this... 110011 &amp; 110010, which obviously leaves us with FALSE,
as there are lots of "bits" left after the AND. If we had 64
1000000, then it becomes this... 1000000 &amp; 0111111 which DOES
leave us 0, so it's TRUE.</div>

<label class="collapse" for="nine">Index Alignment</label>
<input id="nine" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">Here's a quick bit of code to align to
power of 2 numbers. (1,2,4,8,16 and so on). This can be very useful
for memory allocation, or making sure you write data to proper
boundaries.In this example, argument0 needs to be aligned to
argument1 bytes, where argument1 is a power of 2 number. This
little script rounds UP to the next boundary of the desired
number.<br>
<br>

<p class="code">return (argument0 + (argument1-1)) &amp;
~(argument1-1);<br></p>
