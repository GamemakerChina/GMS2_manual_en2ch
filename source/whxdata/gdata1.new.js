A low deadzone will make any slight movement of the analog stick move your player or aim or whatever. A high deadzone value means that the analog stick needs a much greater movement before the game will detect it and move whatever is being controlled."},{"type":"entry","name":"display buffer","value":"The display buffer is the 'canvas' where everything is finally drawn. Some events target this directly (like the Pre Draw event), while others will first draw to the application surface and then draw that to the display buffer."},{"type":"entry","name":"Dope Sheet","value":"The Dope Sheet is the visual representation of the sequence timeline, and where you can add, remove and edit the different asset keys and parameter keys that affect how the different tracks in the sequence will behave over time."},{"type":"entry","name":"encoding","value":"Encoding transforms data into another format using a scheme that is publicly available so that it can easily be reversed.
