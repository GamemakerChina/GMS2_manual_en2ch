Cells are ","not"," calculated as room coordinates, but rather as grid coordinates, where (0,0) is the top let corner of the grid. this means that to clear a cell at a specific\n    position in the room, we must change the x and y coordinates into cell coordinate dividing them by the resolution of the MP grid.
