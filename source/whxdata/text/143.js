For example, a sound asset called \"main_music\" and an included file called \"main_music.ogg\"\n    is going to be undefined when the project runs. This is becuase streamed files are also stored outside of the main project bundle, so care must be taken in these situations.","\n  ","It is worth noting that you can include ","DLL"," (on Windows) or ","DyLib"," (on macOS) files as included files and then create your own custom functions to deal with them using ","external_define()",".\n    These can then be used calling the ","external_call()"," function.","\n  ","WARNING!"," Using included files to create extra functionality in this way is incompatible with the ","Extension"," system, in so much as you cannot use use the ","external_*()"," functions\n    with files added in an extension, since extensions already have a method for adding constants and functions.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Game Settings","\n        ","Next: ","Audio Groups","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["Included Files"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2021 All Rights Reserved"],"id":"143"})
