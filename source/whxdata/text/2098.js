Sometimes the problem can be in the rendering part of your game, for example\n    a sprite may be drawn at the wrong position or rotation, giving the appearance of incorrect physics, or it may be that your calculations are not correct. Either way, this function will help you to find and resolve the problem by drawing what is going\n    on in your physics system. To do this, you need tell it which part of the system to draw, and this is done by passing a value created from the bits stored in various \"flag\" constants:","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","phy_debug_render_aabb","\n        ","This shows the absolute bounding box of each fixture in relation to the room axis","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","phy_debug_render_collision_pairs","\n        ","This will show any fixtures that are currently in collision","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","phy_debug_render_coms","\n        ","This marks the center of mass of each fixture in the room","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","phy_debug_render_core_shapes","\n        ","Shows the basic shapes that make up the fixtures in the room","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","phy_debug_render_joints","\n        ","This will draw each of the joints of all fixtures in the room","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","phy_debug_render_obb","\n        ","This shows the relative bounding box for the fixtures in the room","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","phy_debug_render_shapes","\n        ","This shows the actual shapes that make up fixtures within the room","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","So, to draw any two of those options we would need to do a ","bitwise \"or\""," (in GameMaker Studio 2 this is represented by | ) on the two of them and store the resulting\n    variable for the function to use.
