The \"offset\" defines the start\n    position within the buffer for loading (in bytes), and the \"size\" is the size of the buffer area to be loaded from that offset onwards (also in bytes). You can supply a value of -1 for the size argument and the entire buffer will be loaded.\n    Note that the function will load from a \"default\" folder, which does ","not"," need to be included as part of the file path you provide. This folder will be created if it doesn't exist or when you save a file using ","buffer_save_async()",".","\n  ","The function returns a unique ID value which can then be used in the ","Save / Load Asynchronous event"," to check the  ","async_load","    ID value, as shown in the extended example below.
