When you use this you are effectively asking GameMaker Studio 2    to move the instance to the new position, check for a collision, move back and tell you if a collision was found or not. This will work for precise collisions, but only if both the instance and the object being checked for have precise collision masks\n    selected otherwise only bounding box collisions are applied.
