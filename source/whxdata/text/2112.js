The values that can be assigned are based on positive or negative numbers, with 0 being the default value (meaning that the instance with this fixture setting is ignored unless a collision event is created for it). Here is\n    an image to help explain:","\n  ","As you can see, setting collision groups can be very useful to create complex\n    physical bodies that interact with the physical world around them, but not with each other.
