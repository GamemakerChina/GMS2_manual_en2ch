This is done using \"watch windows\" which, by default, are opened in the ","Output window"," docked\n    at the bottom of the IDE. You can click on each of the different tabs to see the watches that they contain, some of which can be made to update in real time (when real time debugging "," is enabled from the Debugger toolbar) while others will require the debugger to have paused the game.","\n  ","When you are watching ","variables"," in any of the windows, it can be one of multiple ","data-types",". However, due to the way that GameMaker Studio 2 stores certain things, the Debugger does not always know exactly what the\n    variable holds. This is because the internal ID values for data structures or instances are ","integers ","and so the Debugger doesn't always know if the integer value being stored in a variable is for a data structure or an instance or is\n    simply an integer value. For that reason, you can right click "," on any variable value and get a pop-up window that lists the available data-types\n    that this variable could be:","\n  ","Strings and arrays do not permit this option, and it is worth noting that even if a data structure is stored in an instance variable, its ID number\n    is global, so if you have four instances and each one creates a ds_list (for example), each list will have an ID from 0 to 3, and they won't all be 0.","\n  ","Once you have selected your data-type, the variable will then show the entries in the structure simply by clicking the small "," next to its name. This will expand the structures\n    contents, and you can also change some of the values for the variables shown by simply double clicking "," on the value and giving it a new one.","\n  ","NOTE",": you cannot re-assign arrays or data structures in this way, but you can change some of their contents (you cannot change the \"key\" values in maps, nor the priority value for priority queues).","\n  ","Below you can find a list of each of the different watch windows along with an explanation of what they are for and how to use them:","\n  ","Locals","Locals","\n  ","\n    ","The ","Locals ","window shows the current step properties, which includes the name of the current event (or script) being\n      run, the offset in the ","Virtual Machine (VM)"," code for the current script (the acronym \"PC\" is for \"program counter\"), the \"self\" instance running\n      the code block, and the \"other\" instance in the event. This last part is only ever valid when the event is a ","collision ","event or there is a \"","with","\" used in the code. If the instance is in collision,\n      \"other\" will show the other instance (and its variables) in the collision, but if it is a ","with"," then the \"Self\" instance becomes that which is running the code, while \"Other\" is then the instance\n      that actually contains the ","with",". At all other times, \"other\" will simply show the same data as \"Self\".","\n    ","Note that the \"Self\" and \"Other\" instances can be expanded by clicking on "," to see a\n      list of all local and instance variables that are currently declared for the code block being stepped through. If you right click "," on a value you can set its ","type ","to see details of data structures.","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","Globals","Globals","\n  ","\n    ","The ","Globals ","window will show a list of\n      all the currently declared ","global ","variables and their values.

If the the instance code being\n      stepped through has the watched variable it will be shown here, meaning you can easily keep track of a value without having to search for it in the ","Locals ","or ","Globals ","windows.
