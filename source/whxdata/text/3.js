For example, you may find it more useful to ceate a group of assets for each level of your game rather than for each kind of\n      asset, so you can create folder groups called \"Level 1\", \"Level 2\", etc... and store all the different assets for each level in the same folder.

Note that there are a couple of preferences available to deal with how this works in the ","Asset Browser Preferences",".","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","As mentioned in various of the sections above, the asset browser gives you the ability to add tags to individual assets as well as to group folders. Tags are a very powerful tool, not only for organising and filtering the assets listed in the asset\n    browser, but also when programming your game in general, as you can use assigned tags in code.","\n  ","To create a tag you need to use the RMB "," menu on either a folder group or an asset and then select the ","Edit Tag"," option. This will bring up the ","Tag Editor","    where you can type in the tag you want to use, and then press  to apply it:","\n  ","You can assign multiple tags to a single item, and you can also use "," or "," / "," along with the left\n    mouse button "," to select multiple assets and assign a tag to all of them at once. You can also add a tag to a folder group, which will apply it to all the assets within the\n    folder. Once added, all tags will be visible under the Quick Access menu and also in the Filter options (as explained in the sections above), and so can be used to quickly filter the asset list and show only those items with the chosen tag or tags.","\n  ","It is important to note that assets that are created while tags are part of the active filter ","will be given those tags automatically",". This means that if you are viewing all assets under the \"Level 1\" tag - for example - all\n    new assets created with this filter active will also have the \"Level 1\" tag added to them upon creation.","\n  ","Finally, tags can also be used in your project code to identify any asset and then act on it, making it a very powerful tool as you can code behaviours based on a tag or group of tags. For example, imagine you have a project with a \" ","Die On Touch","\"\n    tag. When programming the project, you can check this tag and code functionality that is appropriate, then later the artists and level designers can create new assets of any type and tag them with the \" ","Die On Touch","\"\n    tag then use the asset when designing a level. Any code that has been programmed already to use this tag will automatically include these new assets.","\n  ","For more information on using tags in the project code, please see the section on ","Assets And Tags",".","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","When working with the Asset Browser, you can use the right mouse button "," on any resource or folder to open a menu of options:","\n  ","The exact options available to you will depend on the context that has been clicked, and below we show the contents when the menu is opened on an asset\n    or folder group in the Asset List (other contexts will show some of these but not all):","\n  ","\n    ","Create ","- Create a new asset. On selecting this you will be presented with a list of the available asset types that can be created for you to select one. Note that if you open this menu on a specific asset, there will be an additional\n      option to create a resource if the same type listed just below so you don't have to look for the asset type in the list.","\n    ","Edit (All) ","- Open the resource properties editor for the selected asset(s) or folder group (note that you can double click "," on a single\n      asset too to open it for it editing).","\n    ","Edit Tags"," - This will open the Tag editor where you can add or remove tags to the selected asset(s) or folder group(s).","\n    ","Rename ","- Rename the asset or the folder group.","\n    ","Duplicate ","- Create a duplicate of the asset or assets that have been selected.","\n    ","Favourite ","- Flag an asset or assets as being a favourite, adding it to the Quick Access section at the top of the Asset browser.","\n    ","Add Existing"," - Add existing assets from a different GameMaker Studio 2 project folder. Please note that assets created using a version anterior to 2.3.0 will require conversion as the project file format changed with the 2.3.0 update.\n      This means it may be preferable to import the entire project and converting everything then saving it to a new location if the assets are imported frequently into other projects.","\n    ","Add Existing From My Library"," - Add assets to the asset list from an item in your Marketplace library. Please note that Marketplace assets created using a version anterior to 2.3.0 will require conversion as the project file format\n      changed with the 2.3.0 update.","\n    ","Delete ","- Delete the selected asset(s) from the project.

The values you set can be between -1 and 1 on the vertical axis and the duration along the horizontal axis is always normalised form 0 to 1, making it easy to target different\n      time ranges using multipliers in your game code. Animation curves are comprised of \"channels\" and each channel can have its own curve settings, which permits you to - for example - describe a spacial position with two channels for the\n      x/y position, or a colour gradient with 4 channels to represent a colour format. Animation curve assets can be used when working with sequences and can also be accessed using code, making them a powerful tool when creating your games.","\n    ","You can find out more about adding animation curves from the section on ","Animation Curves",".","\n    "," ","\n  ","\n  "," ","Extensions","Extensions","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","Extensions are additional files and code that you can add to extend the GameMaker Studio 2 functionality as well as add assets to your game from the ","Marketplace",".

Most of the time they have ","sprites"," associated with them so that you see them in the game\n      room, but sometimes they are used as a \"behind the scenes\" controller to do things related to the user or for timing, etc... They can be given behaviours and they can react to certain events as well as to each other, and most of the things\n      you see in a game are based on objects and their interactions. Note that we say \"based on\" because you don't actually place objects directly into the game room, but rather you place ","instances ","of these objects, which\n      are basically copies (or clones if you prefer) of the object resource. This is a very important thing to remember as instances and objects are not the same thing and each have their own set of functions that can affect them.","\n    ","All objects have a set of properties which you can specify in the object editor, like the sprite, whether it uses ","physics"," or not, or whether it is a \"child\" object of another one.\n      They also have a series of built-in variables that can then be used in actions, scripts and code. These built-in variables are used to define the position of the instance when placed in the game room, the animation speed, the direction of movement\n      and a whole host of other things. To control how the object behaves over time, each game frame is split into a series of events, so you can add code or actions into a specific event and it will only run when the event is triggered, and events can\n      be triggered by things like mouse button presses or collisions with other instances.","\n    ","Objects are in a very real sense the building blocks of your game, and together with rooms will form the core of any project that you create.","\n    ","The RMB "," menu for objects contains the following option (as well as those listed further up this page):","\n    ","\n      ","Open All Event Scripts"," - Selecting this option will open all the assigned events for the object in a new workspace as script tabs.","\n    ","\n    ","You can find out more about adding objects from the section on the ","Object Editor",".","\n    "," ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","Paths","Paths","\n  ","\n    ","At some point while creating your games you may need an instance of one of your objects to follow a path through a level. Now, this can be done by simply creating an array of positions within the room and then having the instance move between them,\n      but that can be a chore to set up and is difficult to change, test and adapt for different things. That is when you'd want to create a path resource.","\n    ","The basic idea of the path resource is rather simple - you define a path by drawing it in the path editor, then you can place an action (or code) in an event of an object to tell the object to follow that particular path in the game room. You can\n      set the speed to follow the path and a number of other actions relating to the position and orientation of the path within the room too.","\n    ","You can find out more about adding paths from the section on the ","Path Editor",".","\n    "," ","\n  ","\n  "," ","Rooms","Rooms","\n  ","\n    ","All games that you make in GameMaker Studio 2 need at least one room to run (but can have many, many more) , and a room is basically a space where you place instances of the objects that make up your game and where the action of the game will take\n      place. However the Room Editor is one of the most powerful of resources available to you, since it permits you to not only add instances of objects, but to set up the \"view\" into the game room, add the backgrounds and tiles that are drawn\n      to create the game world, create extra special effects that are independent of the object/instance system, and as well as run code independently of an object. Rooms can also be set to ","inherit ","properties from other rooms, meaning\n      that you can create a single room with a load of tiles, for example, and then make another room that inherits these tiles, so that you don't have to re-create them again.","\n    ","The RMB "," menu for rooms contains the following option (as well as those listed further up this page):","\n    ","\n      ","Create Child Room"," - This will create a new room as a child of the room selected.

Now you could add all the required code into each object that requires it, but in general you'd be better off creating a single function in script resource and then calling that. This means that you only have to add one line\n      of code into the objects to call this new scripted function, and if you wish to change something you only need to change it once in the script and all the objects will automatically run the new code, rather than have to go through every object and\n      change the same thing in multiple places.","\n    ","The RMB "," menu for scripts contains the following option (as well as those listed further up this page):","\n    ","\n      ","Convert to DnD™ / GML"," - This will convert the selected script to DnD™ or GML.

The image used doesn't have to be of a single static thing either... it can be a \"strip\" image too, ie: multiple images in a a single file which can then be used to make a single animated sprite.

Basically a tile set is a single image that GameMaker Studio 2 will break into\n      separate sections based on the values you give for the various settings. You can then use these in the room editor (or procedurally through code) to generate a tile map in your room. They are great for designing any static items in your room, like\n      terrain, walls, backdrops, etc... as they don't have the same overhead that objects have.","\n    "," Above is an example sprite that would be used as a tile set to create walls.

In a timeline you specify which actions must happen at any specific moment in game time, and you can use all the actions that are available for an object in its different\n      events as well as code.
