In general you can click the left mouse button  "," to select anything, use "," / "," + "," to select multiple items, hold "," to drag items into different docks or onto the\n    workspaces, and also the "," to open context specific menus. Note that if you are running GameMaker Studio 2 on a macOS system and are using a single button mouse, please use\n    "," + "," to get a right mouse click ",".","\n  ","There are also a great number of keyboard shortcuts that can be used to navigate around the different workspace elements and resource editors, and we'll quickly go through some of the most important ones (you can find a complete list ","here","):","\n  ","\n    ","/ "," + \"Z\" : This will undo the previous\n      action and works in most of the editors. You have multiple levels of undo too, so you can press this multiple times to \"roll back\" changes.","\n    ","/ "," + \"Y\" : This will redo a previous\n      action that was undone and works in most of the editors. Like undo, you have multiple levels of redo too.","\n    ","/ "," + \"S\" : This will force GameMaker\n      Studio 2 to save your project.","\n    ","/ "," + \"T\" : This will open the ","Goto Window","      which enables you to quickly search for and go to any asset in your game, as well as search the ","Preferences"," and ","Game Options",". You\n      are presented with a list of everything and as you type the search term, this list will be culled to suit, so if all your rooms are prefixed with \"rm_\" for example, typing that will cull the list to show only those assets that begin with\n      that name.","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","/ "," + ",": This will open the ","Workspace Overview"," window which can be used to navigate quickly between items that are open in the different workspaces.","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ",": This will open the manual. Note that when using DnD™ or GML code you can also select an action or a function (or keyword or whatever) and then press\n      "," or click the middle mouse button "," to open the manual on the relevant\n      page.","\n    ",": This can be used to collapse or expand all the different docked windows in the IDE.","\n  ","\n  ","Other ways to navigate the workspace include using the keyboard shortcut  "," /  "," +  "," + "," ","<Arrow Keys>"," to move between any open windows in the direction pressed, and\n    by pressing and holding the middle mouse button "," then dragging the mouse you can pan around the workspace too.","\n  ","When navigating around the various different workspaces and windows, you can use the right-mouse button "," on any text field to open a context menu which will have the following\n    fields by default:","\n  ","\n  ","In some situations, these options may be expanded on, depending on the editor or window that is in focus.","\n  ","Other than those methods of input, there is also limited support for pen devices, and also a special mode for those people working on projects using a laptop. Both of these are explained below:","\n  ","Laptop Mode","Laptop Mode","\n  ","\n    ","If you are using GameMaker Studio 2 on a laptop, then you will have a further option at the top of the IDE for Laptop Mode:","\n    ","\n      ","This will be on by default but can be switched off if you prefer by toggling this\n      button. Laptop mode combines with some tools in the IDE to make it a much better experience when using a touchpad, simplifying the 3 main mouse interactions:\n      ","Pan",",\n      ","zoom"," and\n      ","scroll",". It uses two modifier keys to do this: Left\n      ","/\n      "," and Left\n      ",". When laptop mode is on,\n      ","Left ","\n      ","/\n      "," and\n      ","Left ","\n      "," are \"reserved\" for mouse interactions like panning the room editor, where\n      ","Left ","\n      ","/\n      "," is zoom,\n      ","Left ","\n      "," is scroll and pan. Scrolling in laptop mode behaves just like panning, so it should be\n      intuitive and precise enough so that you don't need to use the scrollbar. Note that when holding these buttons, you simply have to move the mouse - not click nor drag, just move - and that if there is a general shortcut that normally requires\n      the use of the\n      ","/\n      "," or\n      "," keys, you would use the\n      ","Right ","keys of the keyboard instead.","\n    ","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","Touch Screen Support","Touch Screen Support","\n  ","\n    ","One final thing we'll mention here is that the IDE for GameMaker Studio 2 also has minimal support for touch screens. On all operating systems you can use the touch screen to click and drag items in the main workspace, and we support 2 simultaneous\n      pointers, where a second tap will perform a right-click. Note that on Windows 8 and above, the GameMaker Studio 2 IDE will support pen devices too.","\n    ","\n      ","\n  ","\n  ","\n    "," The following pages contain more detailed and specific information on navigating the IDE, as well as information on some navigation tools available to you:","\n  ","\n    ","Bookmarks","\n    ","Recent Windows","\n    ","Menus","\n    ","Keyboard Shortcuts","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","You can also find some extra preferences related to the IDE input here:","\n  ","\n    ","Input Preferences","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Index","\n        ","Next: ","The Asset Editors","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["IDE Input And Navigation"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"id":"72"})
