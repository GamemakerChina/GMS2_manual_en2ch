We have done a pull from master and one of the files is conflicted. This opens the Source Control ","Conflicts ","window, where you can\n    click on the conflicted script, and now click on ","Merge",", since you have configured your merge tool. Clicking merge will now open the tool where you can deal with the conflict and then use the macro(s) supplied to make the required\n    changes. Once you have finished and closed the merge tool, the GameMaker Studio 2 IDE will show the following confirmation window:","\n  ","Simply answer \"Yes\" to this prompt as you've just done it yourself using the merge tool, and then you need to commit this\n    change to signify the end of the merge operation (","Source Control ","> ","Commit Changes","). The Commit window will now show that a merge is in progress as well as show some unstaged files:","\n  ","These unstaged files are our script file with the addition of ",".base",", ",".ours","    and ",".theirs",". We can safely delete all these so click "," on the top one and then "," + "," on the bottom one to select\n    them all. Next, we right click on the selected files and choose ","Delete Path"," to remove them. There's also a commit message pre-filled for us as well, stating that this was a merge, and that there was a conflict (we can add to this\n    or edit it as we wish).","\n  ","We can click ","Commit ","now.","\n  ","Due to the fact that you can have issues with other files, it means that your workflow when using remote or shared repositories should be as follows:","\n  ","Make Changes > Save > Commit > Pull > Merge > Push","\n  ","You should also set up a ","Diff Tool"," for use when doing commits to a repository. This is setup from the ","Preferences",", same as for the Merge tool:","\n  ","The Diff tool is configured in much the same manner as the Merge tool, but only uses the ","${scm_base}"," and\n    ","${scm_theirs}"," options - in this case, ","${scm_base}"," represents the unmodified file whereas ","${scm_theirs}"," represents the current state of the file. The Tool Options should\n    be pre-populated with the default options for ","Meld",", ","KDiff3 ","and ","TortoiseMerge",", just as they were for the Merge tool. Note that GameMaker Studio 2 does ","not ","support the outputting of single\n    file diff patches, therefore there is no default for ","Notepad++",".","\n  ","In order to view changes between current and previous revisions using the Diff tool, simply open up the Commit window and then double click on a file. If the tool has been setup correctly, it will be launched and you'll be able to see the changes\n    between the files.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Source Control","\n        ","Next: ","Setting Up The GIT Plugin","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["External Merge/Diff Tools"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"id":"175"})
