There are also some that store all the key-presses as a string or that can\n    tell you what the last key pressed was, as well as others that allow you to clear the keyboard state completely.","\n  ","NOTE:"," These functions are designed for Windows/Mac/Ubuntu desktop platforms only. You may find some of the built-in variables and constants aren't valid on other platforms and many of the functions won't work on mobiles.","\n  ","Each input character from a key (or multiple keys) is defined by its ","UTF8"," code, which is a numerical value. This value can be retrieved for any character using the ","ord()","    function but, GameMaker Studio 2 also has a series of ","constants"," for the most used keyboard special keys and a special functions. Typically you'd use a combination of ","ord()"," with the ","keyboard_check*()"," functions,\n    something like this:","\n  ","if keyboard_check(ord(\"A\"))","     {\n    ","     hspeed = -5;","     }\n  ","\n  ","So, the above will check the \"A\" key and if it's being pressed then it'll set the horizontal speed of the object to -5.
