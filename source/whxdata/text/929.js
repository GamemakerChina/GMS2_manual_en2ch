These variables we call ","instance variables",", since they will be created for every instance you place of the object in your game rooms, and\n    once an instance is created the values of these variables are unique to that instance and ","only"," that instance. Some of these variables you will use a lot, like ","x"," and ","y",", while others are required less depending on what you want\n    to do, but in general they are very useful and where possible you should be looking to use them rather than creating your own custom variables.","\n  ","Most instance variables can be set as well as read, permitting you to change the properties and behaviour of an instance simply by tweaking the value of a certain variable - you can prevent an instance from drawing, for example, by simply setting the\n    ","visible"," built-in variable to ","false",".
