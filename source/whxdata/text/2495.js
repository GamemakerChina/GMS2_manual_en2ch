You must have previously called the function ","buffer_async_group_begin()"," to initiate the group, then call the function ","buffer_save_async()","    for each file that you wish to save out. Finally you call this function, which will start the saving of the files. The function will return a unique ID value for the save, which can then be used in the ","Asynchronous Save / Load event","    to parse the results from the ","async_load"," DS map.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","buffer_async_group_end();","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Real","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","The ","buffer_async_group_end()"," function can be called from any event, and since it is asynchronous the callback can be almost instantaneous or could take several seconds.
