The debug overlay shows a graphic CPU/GPU usage bar in the actual game window itself along with the current real fps value,\n    number of texture swaps and the number of vertex batches (note that texture swaps and vertex batches will never be zero and will normally show values of 2 or 3, since even with an empty room an no objects GameMaker Studio 2 still has to draw and batch\n    things).","\n  ","This bar is split into sections, with each section being 1/60th of a second.
