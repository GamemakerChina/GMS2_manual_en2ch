Normally all surfaces have depth buffers so if you draw 3D objects to them then it'll sort them properly by depth, however allocating depth buffers essentially\n    doubles the size of surfaces, which could be an excessive and unnecessary overhead especially if your game is very memory intensive or predominantly 2D.
