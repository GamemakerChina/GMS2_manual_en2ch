These events are generated automatically by GameMaker Studio 2 at certain points in the running of a game to show specific important events, but you can also\n      add in your own graph elements using the functions ","show_debug_message()"," and ","debug_event()",".\n      System events will be flagged in a different colour to those events that are triggered through code:","\n    ","When running the game in debug and mousing over these events, a list will be shown of all the events that were triggered at that point in the game,\n      and you have the option of pulling the list out into a separate window for revising by clicking the \"","Click to open in a new window","\" text:","\n    ","\n    "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Resource View","Resource View","\n  ","\n    ","The Resource View shows you a list of all the resources being used in the project that can contain code or DnD™ actions.

Normally you would simply use the ","Step In"," button to do this, but you also have one for stepping ","over ","code and one for stepping ","out ","of the code. Stepping over is useful when you\n      have large scripts to run through, as clicking this will run the whole script or code block as a single step and stop on the next line afterwards, while stepping out will take you out of a script (they will run, but all at once) and stop on the\n      next step afterwards when the scope changes.","\n    ","The final icon for ","real time updates"," permits the debug window to update its data in real time, so you can see how variables change or instances are created and destroyed as it happens.

The\n    only exception to this rule is the ","Profile ","view, which updates in real time when enabled independently of the real-time switch, as it has its own on/off button. You can find full information on this view from the following page:","\n  ","\n    ","The Profiler","\n  ","\n  ","Another important part of debugging your game is the use of ","Breakpoints",". A breakpoint is a place in your project code that you wish it to stop at so you can see what's going on.

Now, when you run your game in debug mode, it will pause at the point (or points) that you have defined.","\n  ","Breakpoints set from the IDE are saved along with your project and will persist over various runs until removed again, however if you add a breakpoint to your code in the Debugger, this will be lost after the module is closed, or a new test run started.\n    Note that all breakpoints will appear in the ","Output Window"," where they can be enabled or disabled or even removed.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Additional IDE Tools","\n        ","Next: ","The Micro Web Server","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["The Debugger"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2021 All Rights Reserved"],"id":"162"})
