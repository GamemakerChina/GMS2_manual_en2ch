For example, consider the following code:","\n  ","a = b == c || d;","\n  ","The different target compilers will perform the operations in different orders since they are not explicitly shown, giving rise to \"odd\" results that you may not expect when you play your game. to avoid this, use the ","()","    to separate out the parts, like this:","\n  ","a = (b == c || d);   //better"," a = ((b == c) || d); //best","\n  ","Also note that when using various operations and expressions in a single code block, these too should be separated. For example, the following ","looks"," like valid code:","\n  ","if my_var == your_var ++their_var;","\n  ","However, the compiler could interpret this in one of two ways:","\n  ","if my_var == your_var++ then their_var;","\n    "," // or","\n    "," if my_var == your_var then ++their_var;","\n  ","Now, you can tell looking at the code that one of those is a bit stupid, but that's because we know what we are wanting to achieve and what we want to happen, but the compiler doesn't. All it sees is two variables with the ++ operator between\n    them so it has to choose which one to apply it to. Therefore, you should ","always explicitly bracket expressions, operations and statements",". The correct version of the above code should be:","\n  ","if (my_var == your_var)"," {\n    "," ++their_var;\n    "," }\n  ","\n  ","This may appear more verbose, but there is no ambiguity about the operations being performed and it will compile and behave consistently across all platforms. Also note that while you can chain expressions and statements without the use of brackets\n    at the moment, this is a legacy feature and going forward may be deprecated and removed from GML, so using brackets appropriately now will \"future-proof\" your code (and is generally good practice anyway).","\n  ","Here are some final examples of the various different expressions:","\n  ","{"," x = 23 div 2;"," colour = $FFAA00 + $00BB12;"," str = \"hello\" + \"world\";"," y += 5;"," x *= y;"," x = y << 2;"," x = 23 * ((2 + 4) / sin(y));"," b = (x < 5) && !((x == 2) || (x == 4));"," }\n  ","\n  ","One final thing to note is that there are also some expression \"short-cuts\" called ","accessors"," for use with certain ","Data Structures"," and ","Arrays",".\n    These enable you to add, or replace data within these formats quickly and easily and without the use of any function calls.
