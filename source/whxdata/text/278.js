This action is normally used in the ","Other - Outside Room Event","    or the ","Step Event"," and you can indicate whether to wrap only horizontally, only vertically, or in both directions, as well as set a margin. The margin value is the number\n    of pixels outside of the room area that the instance must have moved before it will be wrapped around to the other side. Note that the instance must have a speed for wrapping to work, because the direction of wrapping is based on the direction of\n    the motion.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Margin","\n        ","The margin around the edge of the room to check","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Horizontal","\n        ","Enable horizontal wrapping (on by default)","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Vertical","\n        ","Enable vertical wrapping (on by default)","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","The above action block code - placed in the Step Event - will wrap the instance around\n    the horizontal or vertical axis when it is more than 32px outside the room area.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Movement Actions","\n        ","Next: ","Set Direction Fixed","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":[" Wrap Around Room"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Action Syntax:","Arguments:","Example:"],"id":"278"})
