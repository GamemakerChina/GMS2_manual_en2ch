For example, any of the following expressions could be used:","\n  ","x < (room_width / 2)"," a == b"," ++val >= 100","\n  ","If you flag the \"Not\" argument, then the above will be negated expressions, for example \"","==","\" becomes \"","not","=","\". Also note that the ","expression"," is not limited to numeric values and you can check strings, pointers, resource IDs or anything else that a function can return or use (see the section on ","data types","    for more information), but you cannot compare two different data types without getting an error - for example if you try to use a string and an integer in the expression you will get an error. For more information on expressions, see ","here"," .","\n  ","IMPORTANT NOTE",": Due to ","floating point precision issues",", checking to see if two values are exactly equal may return ","false",", since one may be exactly 1, while\n    the other may be 1.00000000000001.

Note that you can \"stack\" expressions in the same action by clicking the plus icon "," ","beside\n    the action, and giving another expression to check.
