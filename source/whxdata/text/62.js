The main options are:","\n  ","\n    ","Show Quick Access",": When enabled, this option will show the \"Quick Access\" section at the top of the Asset Browser. This option is enabled by default.","\n    ","Create default folders in new project",": When enabled, this option will have all new projects start with the default asset folders already created, and when disabled, only a room folder will be created with the default room required\n      by all projects. This option is enabled by default.","\n    ","Maximum number of assets to open simultaneously without warning",": You can select multiple assets for opening at a time by using "," / "," +  "," to select them and then right clicking "," and choosing open all. If you have selected more than the number specified in this option, then you will be shown a warning, since having too many assets open at one time can cause issues\n      with performance on lower end machines. The default value is 10.","\n    ","Maximum recently edited items",": This setting governs the number of assets listed in the \"Recent\" section of the Asset Browser. The default value is 10.","\n    ","Colour Palette Size",": Here you can set the number of colours available to you in the asset browser palette for asset groups. The default value is 16, with a minimum value of 16 and a maximum value of 100.","\n    ","Apply asset colours in Quick Access",": When checked, this option will use the colours set for any given asset type to colour the asset in the Quick Access section of the browser. Unchecking this option will not use the asset colour.\n      This is enabled by default.","\n    ","Group colours override child colours",": When checked, this will use the top level group colour to colour any assets within the group, ignoring any colour that was set for the individual asset. This is disabled by default.","\n    ","Create asset dialogue style",": When you click the \"Add Asset\" button in the Asset Browser, you will be presented with a window showing you the different assets that can be added to your project.

Default value is grid.","\n    ","Default sort order",": This can be used to set the default sort order for assets in the browser, either alphabetical oder from A to Z or from Z to A.

This is enabled\n      by default.","\n    ","Sprite double click opens image editor",": By default double clicking "," on any asset will open that asset for editing, but often when dealing with sprites,\n      after the initial setup when you create the new asset, you open it to edit the image rather than the sprite properties. Selecting this option will open the image editor for the sprite asset instead of the sprite asset itself. You can still open\n      the sprite editor by right clicking "," and selecting ","Edit",". This option is off by default.","\n    ","Object double click opens all object events",": By default double clicking "," on any asset will open that asset for editing, but often when dealing with objects,\n      after the initial setup when you create the new asset, you open it to edit the events only rather than the object properties. Selecting this option will open the different object events in a new workspace, with each event being given its own tab\n      within the new workspace. You can still open the object editor by right clicking "," and selecting Edit. This option is off by default.","\n    ","Room order ungroup removes the empty group",": When enabled, ungrouping all the rooms that belong to a group folder will remove the group folder as well.
