The amount to be displayed is a percentage value and must fall within the range of 0 - 100, however you can still uses larger values with the formula ","(CURRENT_Value / MAXIMUM_value) * 100",",\n    so, for example, you can use this to display power, health, mana, time or anything else that would benefit from a bar display. Apart from the value to draw you can set the direction anchor for drawing the healthbar too (from left-to-right or right-to-left\n    and top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top) as well as the position, either within the room or relative to the instance calling the action. Apart from the position you can also set the colour to be blended from each of the four corners of the healthbar, creating\n    gradients from red to green (for example, but you can use any colours).
