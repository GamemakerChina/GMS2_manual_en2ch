This means that the colour of the primitive\n    faces are equal all over, independent of their orientation or position, therefore, to create more realistic looking scenes you must enable lighting and place lights at the correct places within the 3D world. This section outlines the functions available\n    to help you achieve that:","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","draw_light_define_ambient","\n    ","draw_light_define_point","\n    ","draw_light_define_direction","\n    ","draw_light_enable","\n    ","draw_set_lighting","\n    ","draw_light_get_ambient","\n    ","draw_light_get","\n    ","draw_get_lighting","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Drawing","\n        ","Next: ","Particles","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["Lighting"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2021 All Rights Reserved"],"id":"1483"})
