A Local Asset Package is a group of resources saved using the ","*.yymp","    file format that can be easily installed into existing projects. What this means is that you can create your own library of packages for commonly used resources, like script libraries, splash screen intros, menu systems, etc... without having to use\n    the YoYo Games ","Marketplace",".","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","To create an asset package, you must first have created the resources that you want to save out in a project, and then from the ","Tools"," menu select the option ","Create Local Package",".\n    This will open the following window:","\n  ","In this window you can supply an optional ","Publisher Name"," and a required ","Display Name"," and\n    ","Package ID",". The Package ID will be used to generate the file name that the package will be saved with, and will be automatically appended with the ","*.yymp"," file extension on creation. You can also set the\n    ","Version Number"," of the package, and choose to sign it or not (this is off by default). Signing a package requires you to have created a ","signing certificate"," (you can\n    do this from the ","Marketplace Preferences","), and means that any asset that has been signed will not be able to be imported if it has been tampered with after\n    creation.","\n  ","Once you have filled in the details of the package, you can then go ahead and select the assets that you want to include from the \"","Project","\" section on the right (using the left mouse button "," or a combination of "," / "," and "," along with the left mouse button). Selected resources can be moved to the \"","Asset Package","\" view, using\n    the ","Add ","or"," Add All"," buttons and can be removed again using the ","Remove ","and ","Remove All"," buttons.","\n  ","Once you are happy with the resource selection and have filled in the required details, clicking the ","Ok ","button will open a file explorer where you can choose the location to save the package to. Once selected the package will be created\n    and a confirmation window will be shown, with an option to open the package location in the OS file explorer.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","There are two ways to import a Local Asset Package:","\n  ","\n    ","the first is simply to drag the ","*.yymp"," file from an explorer window onto the GameMaker Studio 2 IDE","\n    ","the second is to select the \"","Import Local Package","\" option from the ","Tools Menu",".","\n  ","\n  ","When using the Tools Menu, an explorer window will open and you can browse to the package location then select it for importing. Either way will then open the following window in GameMaker Studio 2:","\n  ","On the left are the contents of the package and on the right are the parts of it that you want to import. You can select one\n    or more resources from the package (using the left mouse button "," or a combination of "," / "," and "," along with the left mouse\n    button) and then use the ","Add ","button to add them for importing, or use the ","Add All ","button to add everything for importing.","\n  ","When you have everything ready, you can then click the ","Import ","button to add the selected resources to your project. Note that you also have the option to ","Import all"," resources to a new project, which will create a new\n    project for you (and prompt you to give a location to save it to) and then add the package resources to that.","\n  ","Please note that asset packages created using a version anterior to GameMaker Studio 2.3 will require conversion as the project file format changed with the 2.3 update. This means it may be preferable to import the entire project and convert everything\n    then export it as a new package to a new location if the assets are imported frequently into other projects.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Additional IDE Tools","\n        ","Next: ","Project Image Generator","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["Local Asset Packages"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"6":["Creating An Asset Package","Importing An Asset Package"],"id":"166"})
