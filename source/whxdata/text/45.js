The default value is the Top Left.","\n    ","Default sprite collision mask kind",": This option permits you to set the default kind of collision mask to use for new sprites.

Note that this value is linked to the animation mode and - for example - 3 frames per second\n      is not the same as 30 frames per game frame, so be sure to set this value correctly in reference to the preferred mode.

Default value is 64.","\n    ","Default sprite height",": This option permits you to set the default height for all new sprites.

Note that\n      this is only applicable for custom sprite origins that are not locked in the sprite editor. If the origin is locked or the sprite uses one of the default positions - eg: \"Center\" or \"Top Left\", etc... - then this option will\n      be grayed out and unavailable for changing.
