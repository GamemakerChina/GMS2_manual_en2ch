By default the application surface is enabled and all drawing for the Draw events will be done to that and the surface drawn to the screen. However on some older devices and specific\n    chipsets this may result in poorer performance. In those cases you can switch off drawing to the application surface and all Draw event drawing will then be done directly to the screen buffer.","\n  ","You can use this function to enable or disable the application surface at any time in your game, but you should note that it requires at least one frame (step) for the changes to take effect.

This means that you should have some method in place that scales the game to the required device, window or screen dimensions.
