Please note that failure to remove fixtures\n    after they are no longer needed may cause a memory leak which will slow down and eventually crash your game, so you should take care to clean up properly after defining and binding fixtures.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","physics_fixture_delete(fixture)","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","fixture","\n        ","the fixture that is to be deleted from memory","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","N/A","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","var fix, inst;"," fix = physics_fixture_create();"," physics_fixture_set_circle_shape(fix, 16);"," physics_fixture_set_density(fix, 1.0);"," inst = instance_create_layer(x, y, \"Instances\", genericBodyObject);"," physics_fixture_bind(fix,\n    inst);"," physics_fixture_delete(fix);\n  ","\n  ","The code above will create a fixture and assign its index to the variable \"fix\".
