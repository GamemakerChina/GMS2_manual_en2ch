The function takes the ","socket id"," to connect through (see ","network_create_socket()",") and requires you to give the IP address to connect\n    to (a string) as well as the port to connect through, and if the connection fails a value of less than 0 will be returned. The connection uses a special protocol that ensures only GameMaker Studio 2 games connect to each other, however if you\n    need to connect to a server that is not a GameMaker Studio 2 game, you can use ","network_connect_raw()",". Note that by default the function is synchronous, meaning that your game may appear to \"hang\"\n    as the connection is made. You can set a timeout value for connection, or alternatively make the creation asynchronous, using the function ","network_set_config()",".","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","network_connect(socket, url, port);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","socket","\n        ","The id of the socket to use.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","url","\n        ","The URL or IP to connect to (a string).","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","port","\n        ","The port to connect to.","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Real","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","client = network_create_socket(network_socket_tcp);"," network_connect(client, \"192.134.0.1\", 6510);","\n  ","The above code will create a new TCP socket then attempt to connect through that to the given IP address on port 6510.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Networking","\n        ","Next: ","network_connect_raw","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["network_connect"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Syntax:","Returns:","Example:"],"id":"2245"})
