Timelines move forward through different \"moments\", and each moment typically takes up one game frame (like the Step Event of an object). Once a timeline has started\n    it will progress through the moments until it reaches the end at which point it will either loop back to the first moment in the timeline or stop altogether. However, this linear approach to timelines can be modified using this action to set a different\n    moment at any time, permitting you to create your own timeline loops, or to skip sections of a timeline under certain circumstances, etc... With this action you simply set the moment to jump to within the timeline and the next game frame will run\n    that moment (note that you need to have assigned a timeline to the instance using the action ","Set Instance Timeline",").","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  \n    ","\n      ","\n        ","\n          ","Argument","\n          ","Description","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","Moment","\n          ","The moment to set the assigned timeline to","\n        ","\n      ","\n    ","\n  \n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","The above action block code will assign a timeline\n    to the instance calling the actions as well as set the initial moment to 10 and then the timeline speed to 2.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Timeline Actions","\n        ","Next: ","Set Timeline Speed","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":[" Set Timeline Moment"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2021 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Action Syntax:","Arguments:","Example:"],"id":"428"})
