You supply the index value for the shader sampler (as returned by the function ","shader_get_sampler_index()",",\n    and then the bias value, where 0 is for no bias, 1 equals the first mipmap, 2 equals the second mipmap etc... This controls the rate at which the mip map is swapped and will generally make the shader textures blurrier the higher the value and the\n    greater the \"distance\" being viewed. Note that this function can also take negative values too, in which case shader textures will be sharper over a greater distance the lower the value.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","gpu_set_tex_mip_bias_ext(sampler_index, bias);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","sampler_index","\n        ","The index of the shader sampler to get","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","bias","\n        ","The mipmap bias value to use (default: 0)","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","N/A","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","var _sampleIndex = shader_get_sampler_index(shd_Glass, \"s_Background\");"," var _spriteTex = sprite_get_texture(sprite_index, 0);"," shader_set(shd_Glass);\n    "," if gpu_get_tex_mip_bias_ext(_sampleIndex) != 0","     {\n    ","     gpu_set_tex_mip_bias_ext(_sampleIndex, 0);","     }\n    "," texture_set_stage(_sampleIndex , _spriteTex);"," shader_reset();\n  ","\n  ","The above code sets the mip filter bias to 0 for the given shader texture sampler if it has not already been set to 0.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Mipmapping","\n        ","Next: ","gpu_set_tex_min_mip","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["gpu_set_tex_mip_bias_ext"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2021 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Syntax:","Returns:","Example:"],"id":"1341"})
