However, when using this function, only vertex and colour data are being passed in, and so the\n    shader may not draw anything (or draw something but not correctly). If you need to draw shapes in this way then the shader should be customised with this in mind.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","draw_circle(x, y, r, outline);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","x","\n        ","The x coordinate of the center of the circle.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","y","\n        ","The y coordinate of the center of the circle.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","r","\n        ","The circle's radius (length from its center to its edge)","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","outline","\n        ","Whether the circle is drawn filled (","false",") or as a one pixel wide outline (","true",").","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","N/A","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","draw_set_colour(c_white);"," draw_circle(100, 100, 50, true);","\n  ","This will draw a one pixel wide white circle outline with a radius of 50 pixels.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Basic Forms","\n        ","Next: ","draw_circle_colour","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["draw_circle"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2021 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Syntax:","Returns:","Example:"],"id":"1353"})
