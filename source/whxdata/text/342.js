The volume value you give can be between 0 (silent) and 1 (full volume) and the scale is linear, such that a value of 0.5 would be half volume. Note that this action will affect all\n    instances of all sounds that are playing currently in the room, and will affect all future instances of all sounds played. This action is also independent of the volume set for any individual sound, so if you have a sound set to play at 0.5 volume\n    and then set the master volume to 0.5, the sound will play at 0.25 volume.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Volume","\n        ","The new master volume for all sound (from 0 to 1, default 1)","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","The above action block code checks a global variable to see if it is ","true"," or\n    false.
