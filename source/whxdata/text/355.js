It is important that all created data structures are destroyed in this way when no longer required to prevent memory leaks which can cause performance issues or even crash your game.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Type","\n        ","The type of data structure you are freeing (List, Map, Grid or Stack)","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Variable","\n        ","The variable holding the index of the data structure to free","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","The above action block code gets the size of the list referenced in the global\n    variable and then uses a for loop to loop through it and destroy the instances with the IDs stored in the list.
