In particular the function\n    ","font_add()"," can be used to add non-standard fonts, like Asian glyph fonts, in ","*.ttf"," format.","\n  ","It is worth noting is that if you add a font to your game that doesn't have the glyphs required by the text you wish to write, then the Unicode character 9647 (▯) is used to substitute those missing glyphs when rendering it in the draw event. So\n    if your font doesn't have, for example, the º symbol, then writing 90º will actually produce 90▯.","\n  "," ","\n  ","The following functions can be used to get information about font resources:","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","font_get_name","\n    ","font_get_fontname","\n    ","font_get_first","\n    ","font_get_last","\n    ","font_get_italic","\n    ","font_get_bold","\n    ","font_get_size","\n    ","font_get_texture","\n    ","font_get_uvs","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","The following functions can be used to change and manipulate fonts during a game:","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","font_exists","\n    ","font_set_cache_size","\n    ","font_add_enable_aa","\n    ","font_add_get_enable_aa","\n    ","font_add","\n    ","font_add_sprite","\n    ","font_add_sprite_ext","\n    ","font_replace","\n    ","font_replace_sprite","\n    ","font_replace_sprite_ext","\n    ","font_delete","\n    ","font_texture_page_size","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Asset Management","\n        ","Next: ","Timelines","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["Fonts"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2021 All Rights Reserved"],"id":"886"})
