The reason for this is that when you commit, you store your changes locally, which allows you to work away from an internet\n    connection and sync up when you're ready, and to sync up you push your changes to the remote repository. Pulling changes means that you want to pull any changes that others have made from the remote repository into your local repository. However,\n    this means that there may be times when people can be editing the same files, which in turn creates a ","merge conflict",".
