If the system is not flagged as persistent then it will be automatically destroyed at the end of the room it was created in\n    (this is the same as if you had called the function ","part_system_destroy()"," and will also destroy any emitters associated with the system). However, when flagged as persistent, the system will be carried\n    to the next room when the room is changed, and if the following room does ","not"," have a layer with the same name or depth as the one assigned, then a new layer will be created for the system that is persisting across the rooms, and it will be\n    named the same as original layer.
