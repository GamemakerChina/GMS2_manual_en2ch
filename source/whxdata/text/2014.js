A common example of use in programming would be to calculate the number of bits that are needed to represent a number. To do this we calculate the ","log2(x)","    of the number, round it down and add 1 - for example ","log2(100)"," returns 6.643856, which rounded down is 6, to which we add one and it gives us 7. So we need 7 bits to represent 100. It can also be used for describing exponential growth or\n    decay, and is often called a ","binary logarithm",".","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","log2(n);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","n","\n        ","The input value.","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Real","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","colourbits = floor(log2(colour)) - 1;","\n  ","The above code stores the number of bits needed to represent the value stored in the variable \"colour\".","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Number Functions","\n        ","Next: ","log10","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["log2"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Syntax:","Returns:","Example:"],"id":"2014"})
