The first character in a string is always indexed as 1 and not 0 as you may expect, so to copy (for example) the first five characters\n    of string you would have ","string_copy(str, 1, 5)",".

This variable is then checked to see if it exceeds the maximum length of 15 characters and if it does, the keyboard_string\n    is replaced by a 15 character copy of the ","name"," string.
