In any programming language, there can be a variety of number types of various capacities and complements, fixed or floating, binary or decimal. That can make interchange between different programming\n      languages difficult. JSON instead offers only the representation of numbers that humans use: a sequence of digits. All programming languages know how to make sense of digit sequences even if they disagree on internal representations.\"","\n      "," For more information see the ","ECMA JSON Standard",".","\n    ","If you include an int64 in the values to convert to JSON it will write it as an ","int"," if it is in the valid range for an int32, as a ","double"," if it can do so without losing precision or (if neither of those cases is applicable) as a ","string","      with an identifier \"","@i64@","\" before it and \"","$i64$","\" after it. When you come to parse the JSON again GameMaker Studio 2 will pick these identifiers up and re-convert the value back into an int64. This does mean\n      that if the JSON is intended for a server or some other non-GameMaker target, these values will not be appropriate and so should be avoided.","\n    ","If you include ","infinity",", ","-infinity"," or ","NaN"," in the values to convert to JSON, they will be encoded as strings as these values are not part of the JSON standard, and\n      on parsing the resulting JSON they will ","not ","be converted back into their runtime values and will stay as strings.
