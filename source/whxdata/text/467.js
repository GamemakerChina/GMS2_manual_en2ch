You first specify the particle type ID value (which should be the same as the value used when you created the particle using the ","Create Particle Type","    action) and then you can set the gravity force and the direction. Force is a ","cumulative"," value and will be added on to the speed vector each game frame, so a gravity of 1 will add one to the speed value each game frame, while the direction value\n    is simply the direction in which gravity should \"pull\" the particle.
