rh._.exports({"0":["Compiling"],"1":["Prefs - General - Compiling"],"2":["Compiling Preferences"],"3":["\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","The Compiling preferences deal with certain options related to the output when compiling your game for testing or creating a package, as well as certain areas of the compiling process. The options are:","\n  ","\n    ","Automatically open syntax error window on detection",": Enable or disable syntax error notification when compiling. This is off by default.","\n    ","Show the compile window during compilation",": By default the compile window will be shown when you compile your projects, even if the compile doc is closed (it will open for the compile). Unchecking this will switch this behavior off\n      and the compile window will on be visible if open.","\n    ","Show compiler commands in compile output",": This is checked by default and forces the compiler to show all relevant commands in the compile window. Un-checking this will make the output smaller and have less information.","\n    ","Show verbose compiler output",": Checking this will force the compiler to show extra commands related to the compilation process. In general this is only required when debugging and may be requested by support should you have an issue.\n      It is off by default (and this is the recommended setting).","\n    ","Use Subst for drive paths",": When this is checked, GameMaker Studio 2 will create - and remove again when no longer required - virtual drives to use as a substitution for full file paths. These virtual drives bypass any potential issue\n      with file paths being too long for the OS (particularly when compiling for Android or using extensions) and it is recommended to have this enabled. However, if you are having issues with GameMaker Studio 2 creating virtual drives like this, you\n      can disable the option. By default, this is enabled.","\n    ","Show package in explorer on build completion",": Checking this will make GameMaker Studio 2 open the OS explorer window at the location where the final executable package has been created. It is on by default.","\n    ","Clear output window on compile start",": By default the compiler window will clear all previous messages from the compile output window at the start of each build, however un-checking this will maintain previous compiler logs. This is\n      on by default and is the recommended configuration since large compiler logs can slow down compile times.","\n    ","Maximum parallel compile jobs",": This value sets the maximum number of CPU cores to dedicate to compiling a project. The default value is 8 and in general you shouldn't have to change this, but if you are on a laptop or a lower\n      end machine you may want to lower this value. The default is set to 8.","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","General Preferences","\n        ","Next: ","Confirm Dialog Preferences","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["Compiling Preferences"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2021 All Rights Reserved"],"id":"29"})
