The full version details are as follows:","\n  ","\n    ","Stable",": This version is the one you would be using for general development and is recommended for use with any commercial product. It may lack certain features available in the Beta versions, but this is because they haven't been\n      fully tested or require additional work.","\n    ","Beta",": The Beta version of GameMaker Studio 2 is for those that wish to try out new features before they get added to the Stable build, or for those that require a coming fix for an issue. It is not recommended that you use the Beta\n      build for final game production unless it contains an important fix for a bug that is holding up your project. You can get the Beta build of GameMaker Studio 2 from your YoYo Account \"Downloads\" page, and it can be installed and run side-by-side\n      with the Stable build.
