Each component of the colours is stored as a floating point value between 0 and 1, and the new colour is calculated by multiply each component of the\n    source colour by some factor and by multiplying each component of destination colour by some other factor and then adding the results together component by component.","\n  ","This function permits you to set the different component parts that should be factored together to create a custom blend mode. The source and destination both have a red, green, blue and alpha component, and in the following chart the source's RGBA\n    are considered (Rs, Gs, Bs, As) while the destination's are (Rd, Gd, Bd, Ad).
