The function takes the ","socket id"," to connect through, the URL to connect to and the port to use. You must then supply the ","buffer id"," which contains the data to\n    be sent (for more information on buffers see ","Reference - Buffers",") and finally the size (in bytes) of the data. UDP is \"connectionless\" in that you don't actually do a connect, you just send a packet\n    directly to an IP, and the server gets incoming data from an IP address and has to deal with it \"as is\". The data sent is not formatted by GameMaker Studio 2 in any way and the receiving devices will get the data as a stream which\n    means you will have to handle it yourself. The function will return the number of bytes of data sent, or a number less than 0 if the send has failed.","\n  ","NOTE",": This function will not work when used in a project running on the HTML5 target, and neither will HTML5 projects be able to receive UDP.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","network_send_udp_raw(socket, url, port, buffer, size);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","socket","\n        ","The id of the socket to use.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","url","\n        ","The url or IP to connect to (a string).","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","port","\n        ","The port to connect to.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","buffer","\n        ","The id of the buffer to get the data from.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","size","\n        ","The size (in bytes) of the data.","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Real","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","network_send_udp_raw(sock, \"www.macsweeneygames.com\", 6510, buff, buffer_tell(buff));","\n  ","The above code will send a raw UDP packet to the server defined by the URL on the port 6510.
