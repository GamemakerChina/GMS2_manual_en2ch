A user-defined function is one that you define to do a task that isn't covered by the available DnD™ actions or GML runner functions,\n    and can be global, instance or local in scope (see ","here"," for more information on scope) and they can also be used as ","constructors"," to create ","structs",".\n    To find out more about using this action to create global functions, please see the section on ","Creating Action Functions",". You may also flag the function as being ","static",",\n    which means that it will only be defined once the first time it is used.","\n  ","To use this action, you can add it to an instance event and then give the function you want to declare a name. You then provide the required argument names for each of the parameters that the function will take. If the function is to be used as a constructor\n    (ie: it's going to be creating a struct) then you need to check the ","Constructor ","flag and then to call the function you need to use the ","New"," action. If the function is only going to be used locally in the same\n    event and nowhere else then you can also select the ","Temp ","flag. Once you have defined the name and parameters you can add the actions that you want the function to run when it is called in your code by dropping them to the side of\n    the action, as shown in the image below:","\n  ","You can see examples of use as both a regular function and a constructor function\n    below.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Function","\n        ","The name of the new function.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","0"," ...

These arguments are then used in the actions that the function will call to set the direction and speed of the instance,\n    when the function is called. You would call the function using the ","Function Call"," action in any subsequent event, like this:","\n  ","The function is called and it sets the instance direction to point towards the\n    mouse X/Y position, and sets the speed of the instance to 5.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","The above action block code would probably go in the ","Create Event"," of\n    an instance, and declares a new constructor function ","init_char_struct"," with four arguments: ","_str1",", ","_str2",", ","_val1"," and ","_val2",".
