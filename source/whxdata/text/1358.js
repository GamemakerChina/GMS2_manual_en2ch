However, when using this function, only vertex and colour data are being passed in, and so the\n    shader may not draw anything (or draw something but not correctly). If you need to draw shapes in this way then the shader should be customised with this in mind.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","draw_line_colour(x1, y1, x2, y2, col1, col2);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","x1","\n        ","The x coordinate of the start of the line.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","y1","\n        ","The y coordinate of the start of the line.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","x2","\n        ","The x coordinate of the end of the line.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","y2","\n        ","The y coordinate of the end of the line.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","col1","\n        ","The colour of the start of the line.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","col2","\n        ","The colour of the end of the line.","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","N/A","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","draw_line_colour(50, 50, 300, 50, c_red, c_blue);","\n  ","This would draw a horizontal line from (50,50) to (300,50) with a smooth red to blue gradient.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Basic Forms","\n        ","Next: ","draw_line_width","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["draw_line_colour"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2021 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Syntax:","Returns:","Example:"],"id":"1358"})
