This function is for 2D projects only, and will not work correctly when a 3D camera projection is used.","\n  ","NOTE",": Colour blending is only recommended for the HTML5 target when WebGL is enabled, although you can still set the blending colour if it is not enabled and it will blend the sprite as normal. However all blending in this way creates a duplicate\n    sprite which is then stored in the cache and used when required. This is far from optimal and if you use multiple colour changes it will slow down your games performance unless you activate WebGL. if you do not wish to use WebGL, then you can set\n    the font cache size to try and limit this should it be necessary using the function ","sprite_set_cache_size()",".","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","draw_sprite_tiled_ext(sprite, subimg, x, y, xscale, yscale, colour, alpha);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","sprite","\n        ","The index of the sprite to draw.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","subimg","\n        ","The subimg (frame) of the sprite to draw (image_index or -1 correlate to the current frame of animation in the object).","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","x","\n        ","The x coordinate of where to draw the sprite.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","y","\n        ","The y coordinate of where to draw the sprite.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","xscale","\n        ","The horizontal scaling of the sprite.
