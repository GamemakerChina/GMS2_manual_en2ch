The first two arguments are the sprite to draw and the sub-image of the sprite (the same as in the function ","draw_sprite()",")\n    but the next ones are those that define the position of each of the four corners of the ","bounding box"," of the given sprite. These should be given in ","clockwise"," order, so the first coordinate is the top left, then the top right, then bottom\n    right and finally the bottom left. You can also set a value for the alpha of the sprite to draw it with transparency.
