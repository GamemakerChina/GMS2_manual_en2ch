This sequence instance will have the following properties in its ","struct",":","\n  ","\n    ","sequence",": This is the ID of the ","sequence object"," struct that the sequence instance has been created from (see ","here","for more details). You can get or set this struct, and so change the base\n      sequence that the instance is referencing.","\n    ","headPosition",": This is the current ","playhead"," position (in frames) for the sequence instance. You can get or set this value, but note that setting it to a value greater or less than\n      the currently defined play region will have different effects depending on the type of playback set for the sequence. See ","layer_sequence_headpos()"," for more information.","\n    ","headDirection",": This is the current playback direction for the sequence instance. You can get or set this value using the following constants (Note that you can use the layer functions ","layer_sequence_get_headdir()"," and\n      ","layer_sequence_headdir()"," to get or set this value without having to access the struct directly):","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Constant","\n        ","Description","\n        ","Value","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","seqdir_right","\n        ","The sequence will play frames in an incremental order from left to right","\n        ","1","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","seqdir_left","\n        ","The sequence will play frames in a decremental order from right to left","\n        ","-1","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","speedScale",": This property can be used to get or set the playback speed scale.

This is a ","read-only"," property, and will only ever return ","true","      for tracks that are not set to loop or ping-pong.
