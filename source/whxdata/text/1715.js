The device argument refers to the device touch number, which can be from 0 to n and note that the maximum number of touches that can\n    be detected will depend very much on the device being used and the OS it runs (most devices will support at least 4 simultaneous touches). This function is only triggered once by the actual releasing action, and the standard constants of ","mb_left","    and ","mb_right"," can be used to check for either button.
