In most cases this will throw a ","Virtual Machine (VM)"," runner error (also called a ","runtime exception",") which looks like this:","\n  ","Runner errors are generally more serious than compile errors as it means that there is something seriously wrong with\n    your code that neither the code editor nor the compiler have been able to detect, and as such you should pay attention to all such errors. When one occurs, you can use the ","Copy"," button on the pop-up to copy the error to the clipboard\n    which you can then paste into a text file (or wherever) for future reference.","\n  ","The structure of this error is as follows:","\n  ","\n    "," This shows the Event that the error has occurred in as well as the Object (where applicable).","\n    "," This shows the actual error.  So, it shows the ","scope ","of the error\n      and the type of error it is. The first value in the brackets will be the instance ID of the instance that was running the code - or it could be one of the special values listed in the table below - and the second is an internal value that YoYo Games\n      uses for identifying bugs and can be ignored.
