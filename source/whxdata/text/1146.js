You give the sprite element ID (which you get when you create a sprite element using ","layer_sprite_create()"," or when you use\n    the function ","layer_sprite_get_id()","), and then set the alpha value to use. Alpha can be between 0 (fully transparent) and 1 (fully opaque) with the default alpha value for the sprite element being 1.
