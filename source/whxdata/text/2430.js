It is also commonly used to check the integrity of files and strings.\n    This function will take an input UTF-8 string (which has a variable number of bytes per character) and return the 32-character hexadecimal MD5 hash that is unique to that string. In this way you can generate a secure key which can be stored and used\n    to check the integrity of the information being sent to (or received from) an external server (for example).","\n  ","NOTE",": There are two formats for the MD5 encoding, UTF-8 and unicode. Both are provided to facilitate communication with different server setups, but the most common to use is unicode.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","md5_string_utf8(string)","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","string","\n        ","The string to hash.","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","String","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","var hash, str;"," str = json_encode(hiscore_map);"," hash = md5_string_utf8(str);"," ini_open(\"local.ini\");\n    "," ini_write_string(\"info\", \"0\", hash);"," ini_close();\n    "," get[0] = http_post_string(\"http://www.MacSweeney Games.com/CatchTheHaggis?game_hiscores=\" + string(global.game_id), str)","\n  ","The above code will encode a DS map into a JSON string.
