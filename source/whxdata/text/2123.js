Damping is also much cheaper to simulate than friction, but please note that damping\n    is not a replacement for friction; the two effects can, and should, be used together. Here is an image to illustrate damping:","\n  ","Damping parameters should be between 0 and infinity, with 0 meaning no damping,\n    and infinity meaning full damping. Normally you will use a damping value between 0 and 1, but you can use any non-negative value if required.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","physics_fixture_set_linear_damping(fixture, damping)","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","fixture","\n        ","the index of the fixture","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","damping","\n        ","the damping of the fixture, usually between 0 and 1","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","N/A","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","physics_fixture_set_linear_damping(fix_Ball, 0.1);","\n  ","The code above will set the linear damping of the fixture indexed in \"fix_ball\" to 0.1.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Fixtures","\n        ","Next: ","physics_fixture_set_angular_damping","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["physics_fixture_set_linear_damping"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2021 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Syntax:","Returns:","Example:"],"id":"2123"})
