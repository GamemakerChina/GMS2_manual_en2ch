They might be used, for example, to create the surface tension you would see on a drop of water. Once the tension is\n          broken, the particles bounce as if they were elastic, but also continue to attract each other.

In this way you can set different\n    properties (other than the global properties) for each individual particle created.","\n  ","Other than the flags, you can also set the position in the room to create the particle at, the initial horizontal and vertical velocity, the initial colour and alpha, as well as the user ","category",". The colour and alpha values are only used when\n    drawing the particle using the function ","physics_particle_draw()",", but the category value is used in multiple other functions. This value is an arbitrary integer value that you give each particle that\n    you want to have similar properties, and it can be used to set flags later for that specific category as well as a number of other things. For example, if you have defined a \"water\" and an \"oil\" particle, you would give all those\n    particles flagged as \"water\" the user category of 1 and all those particles created as \"oil\" the user category of 2, permitting you to later target a single category to change it's flags or get specific data.","\n  ","NOTE",": You can use any integer value for the category ","except 0"," which is reserved by the simulation and is used to select all categories in other functions (like for drawing).","\n  ","The function returns a unique index (or ID) value for the particle which can be stored in a variable to be used in other functions that reference the particle directly.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","physics_particle_create(flags, x, y, xv, yv, col, alpha, category)","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","flags","\n        ","The flags to set on the particle.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","x","\n        ","The x position to create the particle at.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","y","\n        ","The y position to create the particle at.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","xv","\n        ","The initial horizontal velocity.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","yv","\n        ","The initial vertical velocity.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","col","\n        ","The base colour to use for the particle.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","alpha","\n        ","The base alpha to use for the particle.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","category","\n        ","The user defined category to which the particle belongs.","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Real","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","var flags = phy_particle_flag_water | phy_particle_flag_viscous | phy_particle_flag_tensile;"," var x_vel = lengthdir_x(5, image_angle);"," var y_vel = lengthdir_y(5, image_angle);"," var p = physics_particle_create(flags, x, y, x_vel, y_vel,\n    c_white, 1, 1);","\n  ","The above code will create variables to set the particle type and it's initial velocity, then use these to create a particle at the instances x/y position.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Soft Body Particles","\n        ","Next: ","physics_particle_group_begin","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["physics_particle_create"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Syntax:","Returns:","Example:"],"id":"2152"})
