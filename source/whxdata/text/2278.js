It is recommended that you don't set this too\n    low and keep it at about 1000 for a LAN only game or 4000 or so for internet, or the game may fail to connect randomly.

When using a reliable socket type, there will be a 12-byte header added to all udp packets which contains information needed by GameMaker Studio 2 to check the packet for errors and re-send missing\n    packets.
