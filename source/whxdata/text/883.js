It is a positive integer value starting at 0, and it's worth noting that when creating parameter tracks for \"position\" or \"scale\" keyframes,\n      then you need to use very specific channel values. These are: channel 0 is the X position or the X scale, channel 1 is the Y position or Y scale.","\n    ","spriteIndex",": The index of the sprite asset to use for the track. This property is only available for tracks of the type ","seqtracktype_graphic"," and you can get or set it.","\n    ","soundIndex",": The index of the audio asset to use for the track.
