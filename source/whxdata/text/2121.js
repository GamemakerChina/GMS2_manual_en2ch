This will have a direct impact on how much inertia a fixture has as well as how it reacts to collisions and forces, so\n    if you make a small shape with a high density it will have a very large mass (like a bar of lead), but if you define a large shape with a low density it will have a much smaller mass (like a balloon).","\n  ","NOTE",": If you wish the instance that is going to receive the fixture to be ","static ","(ie: immobile in the game world) then the density should be set to 0, essentially giving it an infinite density.","\n  ","NOTE: A static fixture can be made ","kinematic"," (ie: it can move but without the effects of force or gravity) by making it have a density of 0 and then setting the ","phy_speed_x","\n    ",", ","phy_speed_y","\n    ",", or ","phy_angular_velocity","\n    "," variables.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","physics_fixture_set_density(fixture, density)","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","fixture","\n        ","the index of the fixture","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","density","\n        ","the density of the fixture calculated as kg/m²","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","N/A","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","physics_fixture_set_density(fix_Balloon, 0.1);","\n  ","The code above will set the density of the fixture indexed in \"fix_Ballon\" to 0.1.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Fixtures","\n        ","Next: ","physics_fixture_set_friction","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["physics_fixture_set_density"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2021 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Syntax:","Returns:","Example:"],"id":"2121"})
