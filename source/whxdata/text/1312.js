Each component of the colours is stored as a floating point value between 0 and 1, and the new colour is calculated by multiply each component of the\n    source colour by some factor and by multiplying each component of destination colour by some other factor and then adding the results together component by component.","\n  ","This function permits you to set the different component parts that should be factored together to create a custom blend mode, selecting different parts of different blend mode factors for the RGB components and the Alpha component. So the \"src\"\n    and \"dest\" argument will use the first 3 blend mode values (RGB) and the \"alphasrc\" and \"alphadest\" arguments will take the last part of the blend mode factor. For example, if you have the RGB source as ","bm_zero",",\n    then (0, 0, 0) will be used. If you then set the Alpha source as bm_one then (1) will be used, giving a final source blend mode of (0, 0, 0, 1).","\n  ","The following chart shows the RGBA values for each blend mode, where (Rs, Gs, Bs, As) are considered the source values and (Rd, Gd, Bd, Ad) are the destination values.
