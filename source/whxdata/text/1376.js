rh._.exports({"0":["draw_sprite"],"1":["draw_sprite"],"2":["draw_sprite"],"3":["\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","This function draws the given sprite and sub-image at a position within the game room. For the sprite you can use the instance variable ","sprite_index"," to\n    get the current sprite that is assigned to the instance running the code, or you can use any other sprite asset. The same goes for the sub-image, as this can also be set to the instance variable ","image_index","    which will set the sub-image to that selected for the current instance sprite (note, that you can draw a different sprite and still use the sub-image value for the current instance), or you can use any other value for this to draw a specific sub-image\n    of the chosen sprite. If the value is larger than the number of sub-images, then GameMaker Studio 2 will automatically loop the number to select the corresponding image (for example, if the sprite being drawn has 5 sub-images numbered 0 to\n    4 and we set the index value to 7, then the function will draw sub-image 3, numbered 0). Finally, the x and y position is the position within the room that the sprite will be drawn, and it is centered on the sprite ","x offset","    and ","y offset",".","\n  ","NOTE",": This function may not work as expected when using skeleton animation sprites, and you may find that the function only draws the first frame of the default pose.
