You select the view port variable to edit, then give the view port to target (from 0 to 7) and finally the new value\n    for the variable. The view port is the area of the screen that will be used to draw a given camera view (as set up in the room editor), and the different variables that you are able to set in this way are outlined in the table below:","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Variable","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Camera","\n        ","This is for setting the viewport to show a different Camera View.
