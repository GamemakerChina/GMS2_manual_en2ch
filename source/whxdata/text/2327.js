The buffer should be no more than 256 bytes in size - anything beyond that will be chopped off - and can contain any data you require. The score\n    to be uploaded should be a real number, and the leaderboard name is a string that was defined when you created the leaderboard using the function ","steam_create_leaderboard()",".","\n  ","If the function fails, it will return a value of -1, while a successful post will return a unique ID for the upload and trigger an asynchronous ","Steam Event",".
