However, all further data-structures created from the event must be cleaned up using the appropriate functions.","\n  ","In the example of use given below we will create an audio queue with 10 buffered audio sounds added to it and then play the queue:","\n  ","audio_queue = audio_create_play_queue(buffer_s16, 11052, audio_mono);"," for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++;)","    {","    audio_queue_sound(audio_queue, audio_buffer[i], 0, buffer_get_size(audio_buffer[i]));","    }"," audio_play_sound(audio_queue,\n    0, true);","\n  ","Every game step now that the recording is detected will trigger an asynchronous Audio Recording event where you can deal with the recorded input something like this:","\n  ","var queue = async_load[? \"queue_id\"];"," var num = 0;"," if queue = audio_queue","    {","    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++;)","       {","       if async_load[? \"buffer_id\"] == audio_buffer[i]","          {","  buffer_seek(audio_buffer[i],\n    buffer_seek_start, 0);","          num = i;","          }","       }","    if num == 9","       {","       audio_stop_sound(audio_queue);","       audio_free_play_queue(audio_queue);","       }","  }\n  ","\n  ","Here we check the queue ID and if it's the one we want, we then check the buffer ID to see which buffer has finished being played. We also then set a local var to that index value for checking later and set the buffer back to the start for that\n    sound. Once our local variable reaches 9, indicating that the queue has finished, we stop the sound playing and free the queue.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Async Events","\n        ","Next: ","Audio Recording","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["Audio Playback"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2021 All Rights Reserved"],"id":"98"})
