If not, the default check is based on bounding boxes.\n    The following image illustrates how this works:","\n  ","Here, the instance in the middle is using a collision circle to check for ball\n    objects. Now, the blue ones do ","not"," have a precise bounding box and as you can see, even if the sprite is not actually touching the circle, the collision can still happen (even if you set the precise option in the function to true) as the bounding\n    box of that sprite over-laps the circular area defined by collision_circle. On the other hand, the green balls will only be considered in collision if the actual sprite over-laps with the defined circle. Remember, for precise collisions to be considered\n    ","both"," the object sprite and the collision function must have precise marked as on.
