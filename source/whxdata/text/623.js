If you select either automatic (0) or full image (1) as the bounding box mode then the individual bounding box values can be set to 0. However for a user\n    defined mask (2) you will have to set these values. The different bounding box values are always relative to the top left corner of the sprite (irrespective of the x and y origin) which is considered position (0, 0).","\n  ","Setting the kind of mask sets the general shape for the mask itself, but note that anything other than a rectangular mask will require more processing power when resolving collisions, with a subsequent drop in performance.
