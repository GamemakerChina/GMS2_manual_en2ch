You can then ","name ","the\n    variable as well as set its ","type ","and adjust its ","properties",":","\n  ","The variable name must start with a letter and can contain only letters, numbers, and the underscore symbol '_' with\n    a maximum length of 64 symbols. So, valid variables are things like ","fish",", ","foo_bar",", ","num1",", and ","invalid"," variables would be ","6fish",",\n    ","foo bar",", or ","*num",". Once you have given the name of the variable you need to set its type, which can be any of the following:","It is worth noting that this feature is particularly useful when working with parent/child instances - since you can have a parent object with a set of defined variables and then simply modify them in child object (see the section ","Object Variables And Child Objects","    below for more details) - and for when you add instances into the ","Room Editor"," (see the section on ","Layers ","> ","Instance Layer","), since you can also modify these variables for individual instances\n    that have been placed in the room.","\n  ","The different types of variable that you can create are listed below:","\n  ","\n    ","Real",": A real number is any number that is not a whole integer and can be positive or negative. So, ","124.5",", ","45639.566546456",", ","0.9",", ","-45.5","      etc... are all examples of real numbers. All real numbers are stored as 64bit ","floating point"," values (doubles). The ","real ","(and ","integer",")"," ","data\n      types have an option for setting a range of values which can be accessed by clicking the ","Options"," "," button:","When you check this you can then input a start value and an end value and instead of having a fixed value shown for the variable in the Object Variables window,\n      you will have a slider that is clamped to these values:","\n      ","\n    ","Integer",": An integer is a whole number and can be positive or negative, for example ","30004",", ","19",", ","0",", ","-300",". Note that you can\n      set a range of values for the output integer, as explained above for real numbers.","\n    ","String",": A string is anything that has been placed within double quotation marks, for example \"fish\", \"Hello World\", or \"12345\".","\n    ","Boolean",": A boolean is a value that is either true or false. In the Object Editor Variables window, this is simply shown as a box that you check for true and uncheck for false.","\n    ","Expression",": An expression is a mathematical phrase that can contain ordinary numbers, variables, strings, or GML functions as well as one or more operators. For example ","sqrt(85 * 6) + 5.5"," is an expression.","\n    ","Resource",": A resource is simply any one of the resources that you have defined in the Asset Browser. When you select this resource type, you can then click on the ","Open Asset Explorer "," button to open the Asset Explorer and select the resource you require.","\n    ","List",": Selecting a list type of input means that you can then create a selection of values (these can be strings, reals, expressions etc...) of which you can then choose one or more for the variable to return. To define the items that\n      go in the list you need to add them into the ","Options"," first (click the "," button):","\n      ","You will be able to choose the item as the default value for the variable in the main window from the drop down menu:","\n      ","Note that if you have ","Multi-select"," ticked in the List Options then the variable will become an array of all the\n      selected options:","\n      ","\n    ","Colour",": The colour type is for you to define a colour value to be stored in the variable. You can input a real number (from 0 to 16777216, this will have an alpha value of 255), or a hex value (in the format of $RRGGBBAA), or you\n      can double click "," on the colour swatch to open the ","Colour Picker"," and define the colour there.","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","An important feature of the Object Variables is that they are ","inherited ","by any child objects that you have in the Asset Browser (see the section on ","Parent Objects"," for more information), which means that you\n    can then choose to override or change any or all of them if you wish.","\n  ","When you create a child object of another object resource that has Variables defined for it, these will show up in the Object Variables window like this:","\n  ","You can see in the top image that the Parent object has four Object Variables and in the bottom image these\n    are also shown, only \"greyed out\" and have the"," Inherited From Parent"," "," icon to indicate that they have been inherited.\n    These inherited variables can then be edited if you click the ","Override Variable"," "," button, so you can then adjust the range slider\n    or values, or select different items from lists, etc... Note that when you edit a parent variable ","you can only change the defined value"," but not the name, nor can you change the variable options. Also note that you can add in new Object Variables\n    to child objects as well (and in the example image above you can see that \"Character Type\" is a new Object Variable only for the child object).","\n  ","If you have edited an inherited Object Variable, then you can click the Delete "," button to remove the edit, but not the variable. The variable will\n    still be inherited from the parent, but will use the parent default value again. If you need to completely remove the variable, then you must do this from the parent object.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","The Object Editor","\n        ","Next: ","Object Events","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["Object Variables","Object Variables And Child Objects"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"id":"114"})
