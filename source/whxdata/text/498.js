After the loop is terminated (either by the ","break"," or because the list is empty) the local\n    variable value is then assigned to the instance variable ","target",".","\n  ","An example of using continue in a ","do / until"," loop would be:","\n  ","do","     {\n    ","     var _x = random(room_width);","     var _y = random(room_height);","     if (instance_position(_x, y, obj_Enemy)","         {\n    ","         continue;\n    ","         }\n    ","     instance_create_layer(_x, _y, \"Instances\", obj_Enemy);","     }\n    "," until (instance_count(obj_Enemy) >= 10);","\n  ","This code will generate a random room position then check if an instance of the object ","obj_Enemy"," exists at that position.
