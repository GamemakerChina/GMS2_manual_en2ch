The available options are:","\n  ","\n    ","Run ","- Run your current project on the chosen target platform for testing. For the different compile options available when compiling please see the section on ","Compiling",". Note that this\n      command is the same as pressing the Run button "," in the IDE.","\n    ","Debug ","- Run your current project for testing with the debugger so that you can see detailed performance information and debug any errors or issues you may have. For more information on debugging, please see the section ","Debugging",".\n      Note that this command is the same as pressing the Debug button "," in the IDE.","\n    ","Clean ","- GameMaker Studio 2 keeps a ","Cache"," of files to help speed up compile time when testing. However sometimes a \"stale\" cache can lead to odd and unexpected errors\n      in your game, in which case the first thing you should do is clean the cache from here and re-test. It is also a good idea to clean the cache before you create a final executable for the target platform. Note that this command is the same as pressing\n      the ","Clean Cache"," button "," in the IDE.","\n    ","Create Executable"," - This will compile the current project and create an ","executable package"," (or packages) for the target platform. It will first open the file explorer\n      so that you can select where you want to save the project and then compile the game. See the section on ","Compiling"," for more information on setting up the compile targets. Note that this command is the\n      same as pressing the ","Create Executable"," button "," in the IDE.","\n    ","Show Remote Worker Installer"," - This will open a file explorer window on the location of the installer for the ","Remote Worker tool"," (see ","here"," for more information on Remote\n      Workers).","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Menus","\n        ","Next: ","The Windows Menu","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["The Build Menu"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2021 All Rights Reserved"],"id":"77"})
