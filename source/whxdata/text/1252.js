The amount of each of the component colours can be defined by changing the \"amount\" argument, where a value of 0 will return the first colour (col1),\n    a value of 1 will return the second colour (col2) and a value in between will return the corresponding mix. For example, a value of 0.5 will mix the two colours equally. The following image illustrates how this works by merging the colours red and\n    blue together:","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","merge_colour(col1, col2, amount);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","col1","\n        ","The first colour to merge","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","col2","\n        ","The second colour to merge","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","amount","\n        ","How much of each colour should be merged.
