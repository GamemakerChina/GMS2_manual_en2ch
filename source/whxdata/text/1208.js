Bear in mind that it is up to you to tell it what to do once it gets there, as it won't just stop by itself. This means that you can get a \"vibrating\"\n    instance as it moves (for example) 3 pixels forward, overshoots the x/y target position by 2, then moves 3 pixels back again, overshooting the target point by one and so on...
