The first part would be to add the extension itself, along with the required files etc... and the second is to create the functions and macros/constants that the extension requires. The\n    functions and constants are added using ","placeholder ","files to group them together, so you'd add a placeholder and then define the functions and macros as explained in the section above. To add the rest of the files though you need\n    to first tick the ","iOS ","check-box in the ","Additional Features"," section of the editor:","\n  ","\n  ","Here you give the following details:","\n  ","\n    ","Linker Flags / Compiler Flags",": Some frameworks and third party SDKs require the addition of extra linker flags and compiler flags to work which can be specified here (see the documentation that accompanies the SDK or framework in\n      question for details).","\n    ","Class Name",": Your extension can have multiple classes, with each class having its own functions and constants, so you should give it a name that reflects its purpose","\n    ","App Delegate Class Name",": The name of your custom app delegate class. Setting this allows the extension to override/extend core app functionality. To use this feature you need to do the following:\n      ","\n        ","Ensure that the delegate source files have the same name as the delegate class (e.g. ","@interface MyCustomAppDelegate"," should be defined in \" ","MyCustomAppDelegate.h","\")","\n        ","Add the ","${YYExtAppDelegateIncludes}"," environment variable at the top of your app delegate header file. This will be replaced at compile-time with the relevant include files for the parent delegate class.","\n        ","Use the ","${YYExtAppDelegateBaseClass}"," environment variable as the base class for your custom app delegate. This will be replaced at compile-time with the correct base delegate class.","\n          "," To ensure your extension works with any other extensions that use custom app delegates, you should call any base class methods from overridden methods in your child class. Before calling the superclass method, you need to make sure it\n          is implemented in the class hierarchy to avoid errors, for e.g.:","\n      ","\n      ","- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions"," {\n        ","     // Check if any superclasses implement this method and call it","     if([[self superclass] instancesRespondToSelector:@selector(application:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)])","       return [super application:application willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];","            else","         return TRUE;"," }\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","System Frameworks",": Here you can add in any iOS system ","framework","s"," to your extension. These are added by clicking the "," button which will add a placeholder framework, which you can then edit by slow clicking "," on it. You can find out more about available system frameworks ","here",". To remove a system framework, simply select it and then click the "," button.","\n    ","Inject to Info.plist",": Here you can add any code to be a injected into the ","info.plist"," file.","\n    ","3rd Party Frameworks and Bundles",": This section is for adding third party and SDK bundles. As with system frame works you click the "," button to add them and then slow click "," to edit, and selecting them then clicking "," will remove them (see the documentation that came with your chosen SDK for info on the framework name). If the framework/SDK bundle is on your development Mac then you need to add the path into \" ","Enter framework path on Mac","\"\n      and click the "," button, or if the SDK or source code is on your PC use the ","Add Source"," button.","\n  ","\n  ","If your extension has had any System Frameworks or 3rd Party Frameworks added, these will now be listed in the ","Extension Properties ","window, with each one having a check-box beside it. If you mark the check-box, you are enabling weak\n    linking, which is useful should you need to \"over-ride\" any symbol from the included library with your own value, but it should be noted that doing so will slow linking down.","\n  ","For more information on creating iOS extensions, please see the ","YoYo Games Knowledge Base",".","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","The Extension Editor","\n        ","Next: ","Creating An Extension","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["iOS Extensions"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"id":"89"})
