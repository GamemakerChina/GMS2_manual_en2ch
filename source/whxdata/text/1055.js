You supply the layer ID (which you get when you create the layer using ","layer_create()",")\n    or the layer name (as a string - this will have a performance impact) and then give the new depth to set it to (an integer value form -16000 to 16000). The layer depth is defined as being higher when \"further away\" from the camera and lower\n    when \"closer\" to the camera, so if you have three layers with depths -100, 0, 100, the layers will draw in the order 100, 0, -100, so that the \"top\" layer (ie, the closest to the camera view and so drawn over everything else) will\n    be the layer with the -100 depth.","\n  ","The following image shows a schematic of how depth works for layers:","\n  ","Note that you can check the depth of a layer at any time using the function ","layer_get_depth()",".\n    Also note that the minimum and maximum layer depths are -16000 to 16000, and anything outside of those depths ","will not be rendered",".
