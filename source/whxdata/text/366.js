You must also set a target variable (which can be flagged as a temporary local variable) to store the returned cell value, and the value can be any valid data type. Note that\n    the x and y position for the cell must be whole integers within the bounds of the grid.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Grid","\n        ","The index (stored in a variable) of the grid to get","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","x","\n        ","The cell position along the x axis to get (the column)","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","y","\n        ","The cell position along the y axis to get (the row)","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Target","\n        ","The target variable to use to store the returned value","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","The above action block code gets the value in the grid stored in a global variable that\n    corresponds to the instances position within the room.
