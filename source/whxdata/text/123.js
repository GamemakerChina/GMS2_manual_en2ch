The comments themselves need to be given an identifier (preceded by \"","@","\") and content, and the available\n    identifiers are as follows:","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Identifier","\n        ","Content","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","@function"," / ","@func","\n        ","The full function name and arguments for the function, eg:","\n          ","my_func(x, y, colour)",".","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","@description"," / ","@desc","\n        ","A general description of what the function does.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","@param"," / ","@arg"," / ","@argument","\n        ","The argument type (optional), enclosed in ","{}",", the argument name, and a short description (with space(s) in between)","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","To get an idea of how this would work when writing your own functions, let's take this basic example:","\n  ","function is_same_object(_id, _obj)"," {\n    "," if _id.object_index == _obj","     {","     return true;","     }"," else return false;"," }\n  ","\n  ","All this script does is check to see if an instance has the same ","object_index"," as a given object and would be called simply as:","\n  ","if is_same_object(id, obj_Player)","     {","     instance_destroy()","     }","\n  ","However, writing that into the code editor wouldn't show you the arguments nor give you any help when using it, so we need to add in a description, a function name, and the arguments as JSDoc comments like this:","\n  ","/// @function            is_same_object(id, object)"," /// @description         Compare an instance object index with that of another."," /// @param {real} _id    The unique instance ID value of the instance to check."," /// @param {real} _obj\n      The object index to be checked against."," function is_same_object(_id, _obj)"," {\n    "," if _id.object_index == _obj","     {","     return true;","     }"," else return false;"," }\n  ","\n  ","Now, when calling this function in code anywhere, you will get auto-complete and argument help etc...","\n  ","\n  ","In the image above, the top part shows the function in the auto-complete and the bottom part shows how the argument helper at the bottom works.
