It uses the indicated step size while trying to avoid collision with instances of the object specified\n    by the \"obj\" argument.

The function will return whether a path was found (true) or not (false).","\n  ","To avoid the function continuing to compute forever you need to provide a factor of larger than 1 - the function will stop and report failure if it cannot find a path shorter than this factor times the distance between start and goal. A factor of 4\n    is normally good enough but if you expect long detours you might make it longer. If it fails a path is still created that runs in the approximate direction of the goal but it will not reach it.","\n  ","NOTE",": This function does not move the instance.
