Both these formats have their pros and cons, and the two sections below explain how to import them into the ","Sprite Editor"," as well as a bit of information about how they are drawn.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","A sprite made using skeletal animation, is one in which a base \"skeleton\" has been created and animated using key-frames to move the component parts of the skeleton over time. This skeleton is then skinned from a ","texture atlas"," and the resulting animation exported in one of many file types. GameMaker Studio 2 permits you to import this type of sprite as long as it has been exported as a ","*.json"," format file and has the\n    correctly associated texture atlas file (","*.atlas",") and image file (as a ","*.png",") ","in the same directory",".","\n  ","Currently GameMaker Studio 2 can ","only import vector images from JSON format files made by the program ","Spine",",\n    however the way to import them into the program is almost identical to that for adding a normal bitmap image. To add a skeletal animation, you need to create a new sprite, which will bring up the standard ","Load Sprite"," dialogue, only\n    here you need to make sure that you have selected ","*.json"," from the file filter at the bottom:","\n  ","\n  ","Hitting the \"load\" button will add the skeletal animation to the ","Asset Browser"," as a sprite, with a progress bar being shown as the file is processed. Note that, depending on the complexity\n    of the file, this may take a moment or two. When processing has finished you'll be returned to the sprite properties dialogue, which will now look like this:","\n  ","Once you have imported the animation, you can set the collision properties, but note that you are limited here to simply using\n    precise collisions or bounding box collisions, and that the collision data for a skeletal animation is explicitly taken from the data provided. GameMaker Studio 2 does not generate any collision mask if the data is missing from imported file, meaning\n    you simply won't get working collisions if the masks are not set correctly in the program used to create the image being imported.","\n  ","NOTE",": Due to the complexity of skeletal animations, the preview image shown in the sprite editor is not intended to accurately represent your animation, but rather give you a simple image that represents the animation for visualising\n    in the room editor.","\n  ","Unlike bitmap sprites, the imported skeletal animation sprite ","cannot be modified in the editor"," in any way, but there are a number of functions available within the GameMaker Language (GML) which can be used to change skins, set properties,\n    and control other aspects of the animation. You also cannot set any of the texture options for the sprite, as GameMaker will use the supplied texture atlas that was made by the program that generated the sprite.","\n  ","There are a number of things that you should be aware of when importing skeleton animation sprites, with the most important being that some of the sprite drawing and sprite management functions are not supported for technical reasons, particularly those\n    draw functions that draw only part of a sprite, or that \"skew\" the position in some way (see the individual ","draw_sprite_*()"," functions\n    for exact details of which). However the basic sprite drawing functions are fully supported as are the built in sprite variables. Apart from these functions and variables, you can also set and change animation properties using special ","skeleton_*","    functions, which are listed and explained in the reference section on ","Skeletal Animations",".","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Generally all sprites in GameMaker use bitmaps which - while flexible in terms of content - place limitations on both the size and number of frames possible in a sprite before memory usage can become prohibitive. Vector sprites work around these limitations\n    by storing and drawing their contents differently: instead of a grid of pixels, which can become blocky or fuzzy when scaled, they are drawn as triangles using vector maths and these can be scaled up (or down) without losing definition, as illustrated\n    in the image below:","\n  ","To help you visualise how this is done, the image below is of the same vector Fireman sprite only now we can see the polygons that\n    are used to make the image within GameMaker Studio 2:","\n  ","However, nothing is ever for free when it comes to programming games, and the tradeoff here with vector sprites is that they are more CPU expensive\n    to draw than bitmap sprites and this speed difference increases as the complexity of the animation being imported increases. Also, their memory usage is affected by their visual complexity, unlike bitmap sprites. Baring that in mind, they do make\n    it possible to add large animated graphics in ways that would be impossible using traditional bitmapped sprites.","\n  ","On the flipside of the performance equation, because vector sprites only draw the pixels absolutely required (unlike bitmap sprites which also \"draw\" the empty space around the image) they can be cheaper from a GPU perspective. Also, in general\n    vector sprites are much smaller than their bitmap equivalents - for the fireman example above the sizes of the various sprite types are as follows:","\n  ","Bitmap at 70x68 = 4x70x68 bytes x 12 frames = 223k"," Vector = 54k","\n  ","If you quadruple the resolution of the sprite:","\n  ","Bitmap at 280x272 = 4x280x272 bytes x 12 frames = 3570k"," Vector = 54k","\n  ","So, as you can see, a lot of memory can potentially be saved by using vector sprites, and we still have a lot of potential for future space savings.","\n  ","Currently GameMaker Studio 2 has ","limited ","support for vector sprites. and can only import vector images from ","SWF"," format files. The way of importing them into the program is almost identical to that for adding a normal\n    bitmap image. To add a vector sprite, create a new sprite, which will bring up the standard Load Sprite dialogue, but make sure that you have selected ","*.swf"," from the file filter at the bottom.","\n  ","Hitting the \"load\" button will add the vector image or animation to the ","Asset Browser",",\n    with a progress bar being shown as the file is processed. Note that, depending on the complexity of the file, this can take a while (up to a minute for more complex animations). When processing has finished you'll be returned to the sprite properties\n    dialogue, which will now look like this:","\n  ","The sprite editor won't have changed much, but now the ","Edit Image"," button has been greyed out and can't\n    be clicked since there aren't any bitmaps to edit in this sort of sprite. Secondly, all the texture options have been greyed out too. SWF sprites are maths-based and as such don't usually have textures associated with them, so none of the\n    available options are applicable for this kind of sprite.","\n  ","NOTE",": How the image looks in your chosen preview editor will not be the same as how it looks in your game, nor how it looks in the preview window of the sprite editor. The vector image will be imported at the size it was created at,\n    which is not necessarily the size that the preview is shown at (browsers will normally scale the image to fit, for example).","\n  ","One addition to the Sprite Editor is that you can set the ","quality ","of the vector sprite when drawn using the ","SWF Precision"," slider at the top. This will simply reduce or increase the number of triangles used to generate the sprite\n    - with a value of about 50% being sufficient normally for most games - however you should experiment with this value if you are using extreme scaling, or are having performance issues.","\n  ","There are a number of things that you should be aware of when importing vector sprites, with the most important being that some of the sprite drawing and sprite management functions are not supported for technical reasons, particularly those draw functions\n    that draw only part of a sprite, or that \"skew\" the position in some way (see the individual ","draw_sprite_*()"," functions\n    for exact details of which). However the basic sprite drawing functions are fully supported as are the built in sprite variables. You can also set different ","anti-aliasing","(AA) values\n    for the SWF sprites being drawn using the functions ","draw_enable_swf_aa()",", ","draw_get_swf_aa_level()","    or ","draw_set_swf_aa_level()",".","\n  ","You should also be aware of the following:","\n  ","\n    ","When importing a ","*.SWF"," file, Actionscript is ","not ","supported, so if your SWF relies on it to work correctly then it probably won't turn out right. Similarly, any embedded movie clips that have their own timeline\n      will only have their first frame shown throughout the animation - all animation must be on the main timeline.","\n    ","If your vector file has particularly fine detail you may occasionally find that holes or strange triangles will appear in the resulting sprites. This is because at small scales geometry can sometimes collapse together to create shapes that just don't\n      triangulate well. In this case you have two options - you can scale up the contents of the vector file which will give the importer more room to play with, or you can try to reduce the level of detail in the object that is breaking.","\n    ","GameMaker Studio 2 uses the stage size of the SWF as the bounds of the resulting sprite. However, if you have anything on the stage outside these bounds it is still drawn. This means that you should either try to avoid putting anything outside your\n      stage bounds if you don't want it to be shown, or use a mask layer to limit drawing to this area.","\n    ","The stage size also affects the size of any collision masks that are generated, therefore if you have a large stage size and a lot of frames in your animation you can potentially eat up a lot of memory. So, only use precise collision masks if you\n      really need it.","\n    ","As a SWF file is created from multiple layers, some of which potentially overlap, alpha doesn't work quite the way it does with bitmap sprites - overlapping areas will not look as transparent as other parts of the sprite, as the pixels there are\n      being drawn over multiple times.","\n    ","Bitmap fills ","are ","supported, though if you use tiled bitmap fills as part of your SWF file you need to make sure the bitmap is a power-of-two in size, otherwise it won't tile properly. Text rendering is also supported, but you need to\n      embed the font in your SWF file for it to show up in the resulting sprite. Also, currently only left-aligned single line text is supported.","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Texture Groups","\n        ","Next: ","Texture Pages","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["Non-Bitmap Sprites"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2021 All Rights Reserved"],"6":["Skeletal Animation Sprites (Spine)","Vector Sprites (SWF)"],"id":"150"})
