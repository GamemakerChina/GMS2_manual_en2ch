When you call the function, you need to specify the width and height of the GIF (in pixels, and there is no upper limit on size except for available memory),\n    and the function will return the unique ID value used to identify the gift in subsequent functions, or it will return -1 if the gif could not be initialized (for example, if the width/height are too big for the memory available). You may also specify\n    an optional argument to set the \"clear colour\" for the GIF.
