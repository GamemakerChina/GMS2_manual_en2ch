  <h1><img alt="Load Game Icon" class="icon" src="../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Game/i_Game_Load_Game.png" style="cursor: nwse-resize;" /> Load Game</h1>
  <p>This action will load a game that has previously been saved using the <a href="Save_Game.htm">Save Game</a> action. You give the filename of the file to load (as a string, and including the extension) and the game will be loaded and continue running
    from the saved point. Note that this is not designed as a universal save/load system, and trying to load a game saved from a previous run of the project may give errors (especially if you have used things like <a href="../Data_Structures/Data_Structure_Actions.htm">Data Structures</a>    or <a href="../Particles/Particle_Actions.htm">Particles</a>), and as such you should only try and load games that have been saved in the progress of a single game play-through (for things like checkpoints). Also note that the file will <i>not</i>    be loaded until the end of the current event or script, so any actions after the load action is called will still be performed. For a more comprehensive approach to loading saved game data, see the <a href="../Files/File_Actions.htm">File Actions</a>.</p>
