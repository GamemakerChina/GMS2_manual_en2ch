  <h1><img alt="Rename File Icon" class="icon" src="../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Files/i_Files_Rename_File.png" /> Rename File</h1>
  <p>With this action you can rename any file that has been saved by your game. You give the name of the file to change (as a string) and then the new name (also as a string and including the file extension), and the file will be renamed. Note that you <i>cannot</i>    rename any file that was bundled as an Included File with your game (see the section on <a href="../../../Additional_Information/The_File_System.htm">The File System</a> for more information).</p>

  <h4>Action Syntax:</h4>
  <p><img alt="Rename File Action" class="center" src="../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Files/a_Files_Rename_File.png" /></p>
  <h4>Arguments:</h4>
  <p> </p>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Argument</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Filename</td>
        <td>The name (as a string) of the file to rename</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>New Name</td>
        <td>The new name (as a string) for the file</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p> </p>
  <h4>Example:</h4>
  <p><img alt="Rename File Example" class="center" src="../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Files/e_Files_Rename_File.png" />The above action block code will check to see if the file &quot;checkpoint.sav&quot; exists, and if
    it does it then checks to see if the file &quot;checkpoint_OLD.sav&quot; exists. If that file exists as well, then it is deleted, and then the original &quot;checkpoint.sav&quot; file is renamed to &quot;checkpoint_OLD.sav&quot;. Finally a buffer
    is saved as &quot;checkpoint.sav&quot; (essentially we are backing up a saved buffer file each time we save it, so that there is always a &quot;current&quot; save and an &quot;old&quot; save file).</p>
